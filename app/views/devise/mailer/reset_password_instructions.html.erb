<h1>Forgot something, <%= @resource.first_name || @resource.email %>?</h1>

<p>Someone, hopefully you, requested a link to reset your password. We know, it happens to the best of us.</p>

<p><%= link_to "Reset My Password", edit_password_url(@resource, reset_password_token: @token), class: 'button-green button-large' %></p>

<p class="ignore">If you didn't request this, please ignore this email. Your password won't change until you click the link above and create a new one.</p>
