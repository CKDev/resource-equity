The authors use inheritance patterns over three generations of individuals to assess the impact of changes in the Hindu Succession Act that grant daughters equal coparcenary birth rights in joint family property that were denied to daughters in the past. The causal effect is isolated by exploiting the variation in the timing of father's death to compare within household bequests of land given to sons and daughters in the states of Maharashtra and Karnataka. The analysis shows that the amendment significantly increased daughters' likelihood to inherit land, but that even after the amendment substantial bias persists. The results also indicate a robust increase in educational attainment of daughters, suggesting an alternative channel of wealth transfer.","created_at":"2012-11-09T13:37:31.157-08:00","updated_at":"2018-01-11T13:32:02.023-08:00","url":"https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/3823","year":2010,"position":93,"published":true,"languages":["English"],"document":{"url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/landesa_production/resource/217/Deininger_Inheritance-law-reform-womens-access-to-capital_2010.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAICR3ICC22CMP7DPA\u0026Expires=1542754218\u0026Signature=J%2FZ3zKUJ4v0lDh0Qb916Cc4arSQ%3D","filename":"Deininger_Inheritance-law-reform-womens-access-to-capital_2010.pdf","content_type":"application/pdf"}}]},{"id":201,"title":"Land Rights' for Women: The Role of Village Commons -

These models, especially those embodying the bargaining approach, provide a useful framework for analyzing gender relations and throw some light on how gender asymmetries are constructed and contested. At the same time, the models have paid inadequate or no attention to some critical aspects of intrahousehold gender dynamics, such as: what factors (especially qualitative ones) affect bargaining power? What is the role of social norms and social perceptions in the bargaining process and how might these factors themselves be bargained over? Are women less motivated than men by self-interest and might this affect bargaining outcomes? Most discussions on bargaining also say little about gender relations beyond the household, and about the links between extrahousehold and intrahousehold bargaining power. This paper spells out the nature of these complexities and their importance in determining the outcomes of intrahousehold dynamics. It also extends the bargaining approach beyond the household to the interlinked arenas of the market, the community, and the State.","created_at":"2012-11-09T13:37:30.067-08:00","updated_at":"2018-01-11T13:32:02.023-08:00","url":"http://ageconsearch.umn.edu/bitstream/42661/2/dp27.pdf","year":1997,"position":93,"published":true,"languages":["English"],"document":{"url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/landesa_production/resource/212/Agarwal_Bargaining-and-gender-relations_1997.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAICR3ICC22CMP7DPA\u0026Expires=1542754218\u0026Signature=aDCdQpJm%2BWWvuSHOz%2BwaQ8P%2BO%2Fk%3D","filename":"Agarwal_Bargaining-and-gender-relations_1997.pdf","content_type":"application/pdf"}}]},{"id":205,"title":"Whether Amendments Made To The Hindu Succession Act Are Achieving Gender Quality?

This paper briefly traces that history before examining why gendering the land question remains critical, and what the new possibilities are for enhancing women's land access. Potentially, women can obtain land through the State, the family and the market. The paper explores the prospects and constraints linked to each, arguing that access through the family and the market deserve particular attention, since most arable land in India is privatized. On market access, the paper makes several departures from existing discussions by focusing on the advantages, especially for poor women, of working in groups to lease in or purchase land; using government credit for land rather than merely for micro–enterprises; and collectively managing purchased or leased in land, the collectivity being constituted with other women, rather than with family members. Such group functioning is shown to have several advantages over individual or family–based farming. This approach could also help revive land reform, community cooperation and joint farming in a radically new form, one centred on poor women.","created_at":"2012-11-09T16:13:03.248-08:00","updated_at":"2018-01-11T13:32:02.023-08:00","url":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1471-0366.00054/abstract","year":2003,"position":93,"published":true,"languages":["English"],"document":{"url":"/items/original/missing.png","filename":null,"content_type":null}}]},{"id":206,"title":"Women's Struggle to Secure Land Rights","creator":"Kimani, M.","published":true,"created_at":"2012-11-09T13:37:32.210-08:00","updated_at":"2012-11-13T11:40:01.719-08:00","topics":["Land \u0026 Property"],"countries":["Multiple Countries"],"category":"Articles","jurisdiction":"None","description":"Full Citation: Kimani, M., \"Women's Struggle to Secure Land Rights,\" 22(1) AFRICA RENEWAL (April 2008).","author":"JMR","notes":"From India Office August 2012","first_name":null,"last_name":null,"paths":["/records/206"],"items":[{"title":"Women's Struggle to Secure Land Rights","description":"","created_at":"2012-11-09T13:37:32.318-08:00","updated_at":"2018-01-11T13:32:02.023-08:00","url":"http://www.un.org/africarenewal/magazine/april-2008/women-struggle-secure-land-rights","year":2008,"position":93,"published":true,"languages":["English"],"document":{"url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/landesa_production/resource/223/Kimani_Women-struggle-secure-land-rts_2008.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAICR3ICC22CMP7DPA\u0026Expires=1542754218\u0026Signature=oadZBkXnGRtfG9xpOnBh%2BDaTlrE%3D","filename":"Kimani_Women-struggle-secure-land-rts_2008.pdf","content_type":"application/pdf"}}]},{"id":207,"title":"Women's Right to Land and Property","creator":"Benschop, M.","published":true,"created_at":"2012-11-09T13:37:32.433-08:00","updated_at":"2012-11-13T11:40:21.328-08:00","topics":["Equal Rights","Land \u0026 Property"],"countries":["Multiple Countries"],"category":"Articles","jurisdiction":"None","description":"Full Citation: Benschop, M., \"Women's Right to Land and Property,\" WOMEN IN HUMAN SETTLEMENTS DEVELOPMENT-CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES (Commission on Sustainable Development 2004).","author":"JMR","notes":"From India Office August 2012","first_name":null,"last_name":null,"paths":["/records/207"],"items":[{"title":"Women's Right to Land and Property","description":"","created_at":"2012-11-09T13:37:32.474-08:00","updated_at":"2018-01-11T13:32:02.023-08:00","url":"http://es.unrol.org/files/womensrightstolandandproperty.pdf","year":2004,"position":93,"published":true,"languages":["English"],"document":{"url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/landesa_production/resource/224/Benschop_Women-Rt-to-lLand-and-Property_2004.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAICR3ICC22CMP7DPA\u0026Expires=1542754218\u0026Signature=0PIw1Tr5rBr3P%2FhGi6uzS0C5nUQ%3D","filename":"Benschop_Women-Rt-to-lLand-and-Property_2004.pdf","content_type":"application/pdf"}}]},{"id":1044,"title":"Hungarian Act on the Protection of Families","creator":"Hungarian Government","published":true,"created_at":"2013-03-29T09:31:29.139-07:00","updated_at":"2013-03-29T09:31:29.139-07:00","topics":["Marriage \u0026 Divorce"],"countries":["Hungary"],"category":"Legal Materials","jurisdiction":"National","description":null,"author":"Jmr","notes":"From Jenny R., March 2013.","first_name":null,"last_name":null,"paths":["/records/1044"],"items":[{"title":"Hungarian Act on the Protection of Families","description":"","created_at":"2013-03-29T09:31:29.214-07:00","updated_at":"2018-01-11T13:32:02.023-08:00","url":"http://www.profesionalesetica.org/wp-content/uploads/downloads/2012/01/Act-CLXI-of-2011-on-the-Protection-of-Families.pdf","year":2011,"position":93,"published":true,"languages":["English"],"document":{"url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/landesa_production/resource/1132/Hungary_Act-on-Protection-of-Families_2011_ENGLISH.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAICR3ICC22CMP7DPA\u0026Expires=1542754218\u0026Signature=EiK2o1OJGy%2Fvb14HjKC9MH7xOj0%3D","filename":"Hungary_Act-on-Protection-of-Families_2011_ENGLISH.pdf","content_type":"application/pdf"}}]},{"id":222,"title":"Women’s Land Rights in South Asia: Struggles and Diverse Contexts","creator":"Velayudhan, M.","published":true,"created_at":"2012-11-09T16:13:05.569-08:00","updated_at":"2012-11-13T11:39:40.915-08:00","topics":["Land \u0026 Property"],"countries":["India","Multiple Countries"],"category":"Citations","jurisdiction":"None","description":"Full Citation: Velayudhan, M., \"Women’s Land Rights in South Asia: Struggles and Diverse Contexts,\" 44 ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL WEEKLY (Oct. 2009).","author":"JMR","notes":"From India Office August 2012","first_name":null,"last_name":null,"paths":["/records/222"],"items":[{"title":"Women’s Land Rights in South Asia: Struggles and Diverse Contexts","description":"“In south Asia, since the 1970s, previously marginalised sections of the rural poor started to organise themselves in movements. In recent years, most of these struggles have been directed against the impact of the liberalising state on the rural poor. For the vast majority, there has been an erosion of livelihood avenues, food insecurity, a loss of assets - owing largely to the loss of their traditional access and control of natural resources. Food security is threatened by loss of biodiversity and loss of knowledge. Women who suffer the most from these trends have in all movements related to these issues, participating intensely, widely and also in leadership roles. While many of these movements have been documented, very little is known of women claiming their rights within these movements. At the same time, many other struggles of women are ongoing for land and other resource rights. These efforts have been isolated but exchanges of experiences are growing and suggest a range of newer strategies are emerging, thereby opening up possibilities for more effective response and common struggles.”","created_at":"2012-11-09T16:13:05.611-08:00","updated_at":"2018-01-11T13:32:02.023-08:00","url":"http://www.epw.in/","year":2009,"position":93,"published":true,"languages":["English"],"document":{"url":"/items/original/missing.png","filename":null,"content_type":null}}]},{"id":223,"title":"China:

It argues that land reform strengthened the patriarchal conjugal framework of property relations in the state, compromising women's independent right to property. While agriculture is no longer considered a viable occupation in the state, greater male occupational mobility has shifted the balance of responsibility for farming and family property increasingly to women. However, this work is being under-reported, is not necessarily 'visible' and comes at the cost of paid employment. For some, social mobility has afforded greater leisure but, along with declining inheritance rights, has led to the rising economic insecurity and vulnerability of women.”","created_at":"2012-11-09T16:13:05.521-08:00","updated_at":"2018-01-11T13:32:02.023-08:00","url":"http://www.epw.in/","year":2004,"position":93,"published":true,"languages":["English"],"document":{"url":"/items/original/missing.png","filename":null,"content_type":null}}]},{"id":215,"title":"Landmark Step to Gender Equality ","creator":"Agarwal, B.","published":true,"created_at":"2012-11-09T16:13:04.334-08:00","updated_at":"2012-11-13T11:32:26.017-08:00","topics":["Equal Rights","Widows","Land \u0026 Property"],"countries":["India"],"category":"Citations","jurisdiction":"None","description":"Full Citation: Agarwal, B., \"Landmark Step to Gender Equality,\"  THE HINDU ONLINE EDITION (Sept. 2005).","author":"JMR","notes":"From India Office August 2012 - BAD LINK, no longer available","first_name":null,"last_name":null,"paths":["/records/215"],"items":[{"title":"Landmark Step to Gender Equality ","description":"","created_at":"2012-11-09T16:13:04.385-08:00","updated_at":"2018-01-11T13:32:02.023-08:00","url":"http://www.hindu.com/mag/2005/09/25/stories/2005092500050100.htm","year":2005,"position":93,"published":true,"languages":["English"],"document":{"url":"/items/original/missing.png","filename":null,"content_type":null}}]},{"id":525,"title":"Bermuda Administration of Estates Act","creator":"Government of Bermuda","published":true,"created_at":"2013-02-19T14:09:37.196-08:00","updated_at":"2014-12-17T12:09:06.015-08:00","topics":["Inheritance"],"countries":["Bermuda"],"category":"Legal Materials","jurisdiction":"National","description":"","author":"Jmr","notes":"From Fred Kaplan, February 2013.","first_name":null,"last_name":null,"paths":["/records/525"],"items":[{"title":"Administration of Estates Act of Bermuda","description":"","created_at":"2013-02-19T14:09:37.250-08:00","updated_at":"2018-01-11T13:32:02.023-08:00","url":"http://www.bermudalaws.bm/Laws/Consolidated%20Laws/Administration%20of%20Estates%20Act%201974.pdf","year":1974,"position":93,"published":true,"languages":["English"],"document":{"url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/landesa_production/resource/566/Bermuda_Administration-of-Estates-Act_1974_ENGLISH.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAICR3ICC22CMP7DPA\u0026Expires=1542754218\u0026Signature=KX7Zl5TMjlxbl0b61JtR92rTnT8%3D","filename":"Bermuda_Administration-of-Estates-Act_1974_ENGLISH.pdf","content_type":"application/pdf"}}]},{"id":524,"title":"Bermuda Constitution","creator":"Government of Bermuda","published":true,"created_at":"2013-02-19T14:09:37.099-08:00","updated_at":"2014-12-17T12:09:35.828-08:00","topics":["Constitution"],"countries":["Bermuda"],"category":"Legal Materials","jurisdiction":"National","description":"","author":"Jmr","notes":"From Fred Kaplan, February 2013.","first_name":null,"last_name":null,"paths":["/records/524"],"items":[{"title":"Constitution of Bermuda","description":"","created_at":"2013-02-19T14:09:37.146-08:00","updated_at":"2018-01-11T13:32:02.023-08:00","url":"http://www.bermudalaws.bm/Laws/Consolidated%20Laws/Bermuda%20Constitution%20Order%201968.pdf","year":1968,"position":93,"published":true,"languages":["English"],"document":{"url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/landesa_production/resource/565/Bermuda_Constitution_1968_ENGLISH.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAICR3ICC22CMP7DPA\u0026Expires=1542754218\u0026Signature=tLxOl4ExB55YcJ0WqeaEzA9if48%3D","filename":"Bermuda_Constitution_1968_ENGLISH.pdf","content_type":"application/pdf"}}]},{"id":216,"title":"Marital Violence, Human development and Women's Property Status in India","creator":"Panda, P. and Agarwal, B.","published":true,"created_at":"2012-11-09T16:13:04.502-08:00","updated_at":"2012-11-13T11:33:38.614-08:00","topics":["Marriage \u0026 Divorce","Land \u0026 Property"],"countries":["India"],"category":"Citations","jurisdiction":"None","description":"Full Citation: Panda, P. and Agarwal, B., \"Marital Violence, Human Development and Women's Property Status in India,\" 33(5) WORLD DEVELOPMENT 850 (2005).","author":"JMR","notes":"From India Office August 2012","first_name":null,"last_name":null,"paths":["/records/216"],"items":[{"title":"Marital Violence, Human development and Women's Property Status in India","description":"Summary:  If development means the expansion of human capabilities, then freedom from domestic violence should be an integral part of any exercise for evaluating developmental progress. This paper focuses on a hitherto unexplored factor underlying women’s risk of marital violence, namely, women’s property status. Many studies have examined the scale and correlates of marital violence, but neglected this dimension. Based on a household survey in Kerala (India), the authors assess the prevalence and correlates of both physical and psychological violence—long term and current. Women owning immovable property (land or a house) are found to face a significantly lower risk of marital violence than propertyless women.

It outlines why in rural South Asia, where arable land is the most important form of property, any significant improvement in women's economic and social situation is crucially tied to their having independent land rights. Better employment opportunities can complement but not substitute for land. But despite progressive legislation few South Asian women own land; even fewer effectively control any. Why? A complex range of factors — social, administrative, and ideological — are found to underlie the persistent gap between women's legal rights and their actual ownership of land, and between ownership and control. The necessity of collective action by women for overcoming these obstacles and the aspects needing a specific focus for policy and action are also discussed.","created_at":"2012-11-09T16:13:03.143-08:00","updated_at":"2018-01-11T13:32:02.023-08:00","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0305750X94900310","year":1994,"position":93,"published":true,"languages":["English"],"document":{"url":"/items/original/missing.png","filename":null,"content_type":null}}]},{"id":212,"title":"Gender and Productive Assets: Implications for Women’s Economic Security and Productivity","creator":"Kelkar, G.","published":true,"created_at":"2012-11-09T16:13:03.578-08:00","updated_at":"2012-11-13T11:30:49.897-08:00","topics":["Equal Rights","Land \u0026 Property"],"countries":["Multiple Countries"],"category":"Citations","jurisdiction":"None","description":"Full Citation: Kelkar, G., \"Gender and Productive Assets: Implications for Women's Economic Security and Productivity,\" 23 ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL WEEKLY (June 2011).","author":"JMR","notes":"From India Office August 2012","first_name":null,"last_name":null,"paths":["/records/212"],"items":[{"title":"Gender and Productive Assets: Implications for Women’s Economic Security and Productivity","description":"﻿“Asset ownership and control rights are preferable to numerous policy alternatives for women's empowerment.

While there is general agreement that few women own key assets, there is no systematic sex-disaggregated asset data to measure or monitor. Households are the unit of analysis in standard surveys, where the only feasible gender analysis is by sex of the household head.

In India, the Hindu Succession Rights Act (HSA) of 1956 allows the wife and daughters, along with the sons of the deceased senior male, to claim an equal share in familial property. By giving inheritance rights to daughters and widows, not only to sons, this Act proposes a radically different organization of the ideal household, commonly referred to as the ‘Indian joint family’. The Act initiates a transformation of Hindu women’s status through their rights to property, which implies the transformation of women’s rights and duties in India. It also affects men’s access to natal property and modifies brother-sister relationships. Moreover, it redefines some religious categories. Firstly, under this Act the category ‘Hindu’ includes Hindu, Buddhist, Jain or Sikh.

Gender bias was explicit in the implementation of both policies in the village between 1980 and the mid-1990s. Since that time, explicit gender bias has been reduced and both policies have stressed market incentives more, reflecting China’s modernization goals and accession to the WTO. Yet the policies are not gender neutral in their implementation, effects, and interactions. Women remain the target of the eased population policy, and they are more likely to become ‘‘landless’’ at marriage. The policies work together to reinforce traditional and emerging forms of gender bias, though at times they offset each other. They impact women’s bargaining power within the home, status in the community, and social security. Together they provide a richer view of the gendered experience of living in the village.","created_at":"2012-11-13T16:36:20.651-08:00","updated_at":"2018-01-11T13:32:02.023-08:00","url":"http://www.tandfonline.com/toc/rfec20/13/3-4","year":2007,"position":93,"published":true,"languages":["English"],"document":{"url":"/items/original/missing.png","filename":null,"content_type":null}}]},{"id":235,"title":"Family Management and Family Division in Contemporary Rural China ","creator":"Cohen, M.

The purposes of CFM are to improve forestry economic systems, strengthen resource management in a market economy, ease the conflicts between wood demands and public welfare, and meet the diversified needs for forest services in China. The formative process of China’s CFM has involved a series of trials and revisions. China’s central government accelerated the reform of CFM in the year 2000 and completed the final version in 2003. CFM was implemented at the provincial level with the aid of subsidies from the central government. About a quarter of the forestland in China was approved as National EWF lands by the State Forestry Administration in 2006 and 2007. Logging is prohibited on National EWF lands, and their landowners or managers receive subsidies of about 70 RMB (US$10) per hectare from the central government. CFM represents a new forestry strategy in China and its implementation inevitably faces challenges in promoting the understanding of forest ecological services, generalizing nationwide criteria for identifying EWF and CoF lands, setting up forest-specific compensation mechanisms for ecological benefits, enhancing the knowledge of administrators and the general public about CFM, and sustaining EWF lands under China’s current forestland tenure system. CFM does, however, offer a viable pathway toward sustainable forest management in China.","created_at":"2012-11-13T16:36:21.155-08:00","updated_at":"2018-01-11T13:32:02.023-08:00","url":"http://www.springerlink.com/content/23163228664r4281/","year":2008,"position":93,"published":true,"languages":["English"],"document":{"url":"/items/original/missing.png","filename":null,"content_type":null}}]},{"id":237,"title":"Feminization of Agriculture in China?

The article uses two high quality data sets to explore who is working on China’s farms and the effects of the labour allocation decisions of rural households on labour use, productivity and welfare. It makes three main contributions. First, we establish a conceptual framework within which to define the different dimensions of agricultural feminization and its expected consequences. Second, as a contribution to the China literature and contrary to popular perceptions, we believe we have mostly debunked the myth that China’s agriculture is becoming feminized; it is not. We also find that even if women were taking over farms, the consequences in China would be mostly positive – from a labour supply, productivity and income point of view. Finally, there may be some lessons for the rest of the world on what policies and institutions help make women productive when they work on and manage a nation’s agricultural sector. Policies that ensure equal access to land, regulations that dictate open access to credit, and economic development strategies that encourage competitive and efficient markets all contribute to an environment in which women farmers can succeed.","created_at":"2012-11-13T16:36:21.267-08:00","updated_at":"2018-01-11T13:32:02.023-08:00","url":"http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online\u0026aid=1905328","year":2008,"position":93,"published":true,"languages":["English"],"document":{"url":"/items/original/missing.png","filename":null,"content_type":null}}]},{"id":238,"title":"Land Management in Rural China and Its Gender Implications ","creator":"Hare, D., Yang, L., and Englander, D.","published":true,"created_at":"2012-11-13T16:36:21.312-08:00","updated_at":"2012-11-13T16:36:21.312-08:00","topics":["Land \u0026 Property"],"countries":["China"],"category":"Citations","jurisdiction":"None","description":"Full Citation: Hare, D., Yang, L., and Englander, D., ‘‘Land management in rural China and its gender implications,’’ 13(3-4)FEMINIST ECONOMICS 35 (2007).","author":"JMR","notes":"From China Office August 2012","first_name":null,"last_name":null,"paths":["/records/238"],"items":[{"title":"Land Management in Rural China and Its Gender Implications ","description":"Women are an important mainstay of agricultural production in China, though their access to land is characterized by even greater ambiguity than that of their male counterparts. As part of its path toward liberalization, China undertook agricultural land management policy reforms that were aimed at increasing the security of land tenure rights, but these reforms have paradoxically exacerbated the uncertainty surrounding women’s claims to land. Utilizing sample survey data collected from 412 rural households in Shaanxi and Hunan provinces in 2002, this paper documents and analyzes gender differences in land allocations. The findings of this study shed light on the degree to which community characteristics coupled with current local practices (such as frequency of reallocation) influence gender disparities. Results suggest that a growing number of women experience loss of contract land coincident with marrying, and this trend may be expected to increase given the current direction of land policy.","created_at":"2012-11-13T16:36:21.451-08:00","updated_at":"2018-01-11T13:32:02.023-08:00","url":"http://www.tandfonline.com/toc/rfec20/13/3-4","year":2007,"position":93,"published":true,"languages":["English"],"document":{"url":"/items/original/missing.png","filename":null,"content_type":null}}]},{"id":239,"title":"Aspects of Marriage in Three Southwestern Villages ","creator":"Harrell, S.","published":true,"created_at":"2012-11-13T16:36:21.494-08:00","updated_at":"2012-11-13T16:36:21.494-08:00","topics":["Marriage \u0026 Divorce"],"countries":["China"],"category":"Citations","jurisdiction":"None","description":"Full Citation: Harrell, S., \"Aspects of Marriage in Three South-western Villages,\" 130 THE CHINA QUARTERLY 323 (1992).","author":"JMR","notes":"From China Office August 2012","first_name":null,"last_name":null,"paths":["/records/239"],"items":[{"title":"Aspects of Marriage in Three Southwestern Villages ","description":"In their effect on marriage and the family, as in so many other domains, the reforms can be seen as having a dual thrust.

It follows upon a series of earlier changes — land reform, collectivization and the first wave of contracting land to households — that paid attention to women’s role in publicly recognized work and provided access to land. The new regime, which has gradually come into effect as previous (usually fifteen-year) terms expired, authorizes an adjustment in land allocation which is then normally frozen for thirty years. An apparently inadvertent effect of this policy is not only the exclusion of young people from direct access to land for up to thirty years from birth, but the de facto separation of the majority of women who marry or remarry patrilocally from allocated land. ‘No change for thirty years’ (sanshi nian bu bian) has thus become the distinctive feature for women of China’s current land-use regime. The state has renounced its potential to reallocate land periodically and there is no indication that market mechanisms are filling, or are capable of filling, the void thereby created. This article examines local conceptions, responses and practices regarding land-use rights and their transfer within this new framework, using field evidence from three upland agricultural communities in Chongqing and Sichuan (studied in 2003, 2004 and 2005), where land allocations were fixed in 1995, 1999 and 2001 respectively. The ethnographic findings are further explored in relation to contemporary research on gender and land rights.","created_at":"2012-11-13T16:36:22.119-08:00","updated_at":"2018-01-11T13:32:02.023-08:00","url":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-7660.2007.00429.x/abstract","year":2007,"position":93,"published":true,"languages":["English"],"document":{"url":"/items/original/missing.png","filename":null,"content_type":null}}]},{"id":244,"title":"Patrilocality and Early Marital Co-residence in Rural China ","creator":"Lavely, W. and Ren, X.","published":true,"created_at":"2012-11-13T16:36:22.191-08:00","updated_at":"2012-11-13T16:36:22.191-08:00","topics":["Marriage \u0026 Divorce","Customary Practices"],"countries":["China"],"category":"Citations","jurisdiction":"None","description":"Full Citation: Lavely, W. and Ren, X., \"Patrilocality and Early Marital Co-residence in Rural China, 1955–85,\" 130 THE CHINA QUARTERLY 378 (1992).","author":"JMR","notes":"From China Office August 2012","first_name":null,"last_name":null,"paths":["/records/244"],"items":[{"title":"Patrilocality and Early Marital Co-residence in Rural China ","description":"The story of the rural Chinese family household in the post-Mao period is generally told in one of three ways, which might be labelled modernization, tradition restored, and demographic determinism. Modernization parallels the family theories of classical sociology: economic development and education tend to undermine extended family living arrangements by instilling nuclear family preferences, while the relaxation of migration restrictions allows young men to seek their fortune away from home. “Tradition restored” sees collectivization as having undermined the foundation of the extended family household, the family economy. The return of family farming has, in this view, restored the conditions under which the extended family can flourish. The demographic determinisi view assumes that family preferences persist but that demographic structures change. Rising life expectancies and declining fertility should increase rates of family extension, since smaller families mean that there will be fewer brothers available to live with a surviving parent. Thus as the birth control cohorts come of age, the prevalence of extended households should increase.","created_at":"2012-11-13T16:36:22.231-08:00","updated_at":"2018-01-11T13:32:02.023-08:00","url":"http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online\u0026aid=3563240\u0026fulltextType=RA\u0026fileId=S0305741000040789","year":1992,"position":93,"published":true,"languages":["English"],"document":{"url":"/items/original/missing.png","filename":null,"content_type":null}}]},{"id":246,"title":"Assessing Farmland Protection Policy in China ","creator":"Lichtenberg, E. and Ding, C.","published":true,"created_at":"2012-11-13T16:36:22.497-08:00","updated_at":"2012-11-13T16:36:22.497-08:00","topics":["Land \u0026 Property"],"countries":["China"],"category":"Citations","jurisdiction":"None","description":"Full Citation: Lichtenberg, E. and Ding, C., \"Assessing farmland protection policy in China,\" 25(1) LAND USE POLICY 59 (2008).","author":"JMR","notes":"From China Office August 2012","first_name":null,"last_name":null,"paths":["/records/246"],"items":[{"title":"Assessing Farmland Protection Policy in China ","description":"ABSTRACT: The government of China targeted conversion of farmland to industrial and residential uses, especially in the most productive agricultural regions, as the chief threat to the nation's continued capacity to produce adequate levels of staple cereals. In response, it has introduced a number of measures aimed at protecting farmland, especially farmland with the greatest production potential. This paper reviews the existing evidence regarding the performance of China's farmland protection policies in light of its food security goals. We summarize recent farmland protection measures. Despite administrative restrictions on farmland conversion, cropland continues to decline. The evidence suggests that a substantial share of farmland losses does not represent a reduction in food production capacity. It also suggests that increases in other factors of production can compensate for farmland losses and that farmland protection is not the most efficient—or even a necessary—means of meeting China's food security goals. However, the existing institutional and policy structure create incentives for both insufficient farmland retention and excessive farmland conversion, resulting in significant inefficiencies in land use. We discuss the implications of these failures for future policy development, with an emphasis on reform of the land allocation system.","created_at":"2012-11-13T16:36:22.647-08:00","updated_at":"2018-01-11T13:32:02.023-08:00","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S026483770700021X","year":2007,"position":93,"published":true,"languages":["English"],"document":{"url":"/items/original/missing.png","filename":null,"content_type":null}}]},{"id":248,"title":"The Recently Revised Marriage Law of China: The Promise and the Reality ","creator":"Ogletree, C.

The reforms have been evolving and vary significantly from region to region.

Despite variations in time and place, a trend towards privatization started to become apparent when the central government began a pilot experiment called the “new stage of forestland tenure reform” in the early 2000s and went on to implement the reform nationwide. This paper compares various paths towards decentralization and privatization and the adoption of market mechanisms in collective forestry, but pays special attention to the new reforms by examining and comparing 9 villages in 3 provinces in southeast China where collective forest ownership is dominant.

It began with the devolution of forest tenures in rural areas, but led to reform of state-owned forest enterprises via introduction of stumpage fees and liberalized forest product prices. From the early 1990s to 1998, while China increasingly embraced the market economy, the nation’s natural forests continued to be depleted despite repeated emphasis on sustainable development. Then, in the wake of the 1998 floods in the Yangtze River basin, there was a shift in focus from timber production to environmental protection, with policy redirected toward the rehabilitation of damaged forest ecosystems, afforestation in desertified and degraded areas, and a ban on logging in natural forests.

Village officials usually have the power to reallocate land property across families on an ongoing basis due to demographic changes in the village. Realizing that frequent land reallocation and abusive land requisition will undermine economic productivity as well as social stability, the “Rural Land Contract Law” passed in 2002 explicitly reads that farmland tenure security must be maintained for at least 30 years since the last nationwide reallocation in 1998. The frequency and magnitude of land reallocation in Chinese villages have decreased as a result. However, failure to allocate land to the newly increased population often induced conflicts among village members if the security of land tenure for 30 years was strictly implemented. Administrative land reallocations then still continued in some villages to accommodate demographic changes in these places. Based on an almost nationally representative rural dataset collected in 119 villages of 6 provinces across China in 2008, this paper lays out some stylized facts about the administrative land reallocation after 1998. By analyzing the opinions of over 2200 farmers on the central policy of maintaining farmland tenure security, we are able to rationalize why some farmers support the policy while others oppose it. This analysis helps us to better understand the dilemma between efficiency and equity embedded in the current agricultural land system in China. It is further shown that social conflicts among village members may easily arise either due to administrative land reallocation or due to lack of it. We argue that this dilemma cannot be resolved effectively without coordinated reforms in household registration system which can help hundreds of millions of Chinese rural migrant workers to permanently settle in cities and release their farmland to those who stay in the countryside.","created_at":"2012-11-13T16:36:24.946-08:00","updated_at":"2018-01-11T13:32:02.023-08:00","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264837711000160","year":2011,"position":93,"published":true,"languages":["English"],"document":{"url":"/items/original/missing.png","filename":null,"content_type":null}}]},{"id":257,"title":"Introduction: Rural Economic Reforms and Chinese Family Patterns ","creator":"Whyte, M.K.","published":true,"created_at":"2012-11-13T16:36:24.999-08:00","updated_at":"2012-11-13T16:36:24.999-08:00","topics":["Land \u0026 Property","Marriage \u0026 Divorce"],"countries":["China"],"category":"Citations","jurisdiction":"None","description":"Full Citation: Whyte, M.

In the wake of the demise of the familiar and fairly standardized pattern represented by people's communes, many questions arose for debate. How much of the collective system remained in rural China after decollectivization? To what extent did the revived system of family farming represent a return to pre-socialist organizational patterns, or was any resemblance to the past superficial and misleading?

The study reveals that TGP resettlement is leaving women worse off as family members, as well as worse off than male members. Woman resettlers are more likely to become impoverished than men, partly because women make up the main labour force in agricultural sectors. Most women are unable to achieve occupational mobility in the process of resettlement. Fewer employment opportunities, a gender-segregated labour market, low level of human capital and social prejudice are principal causes. Land provision for resettlers is inadequate with a lower quality of productivity. Marriage is a means for some women to remain in or move to the reservoir area to improve their socio-economic status, but bias against granting of ‘resettler’ status to married women and their generally low levels of education and lack of occupational skills work against them. It is imperative that the authorities integrate a gender perspective into policy-making and design of resettlement schemes.","created_at":"2012-11-13T16:36:25.243-08:00","updated_at":"2018-01-11T13:32:02.023-08:00","url":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.0012-155X.2005.00431.x/abstract","year":2005,"position":93,"published":true,"languages":["English"],"document":{"url":"/items/original/missing.png","filename":null,"content_type":null}}]},{"id":259,"title":"Increasing Women's Participation in Village Government in China: Is It Worth It?","creator":"Jacka, T.","published":true,"created_at":"2012-11-13T16:36:25.352-08:00","updated_at":"2012-11-13T16:36:25.352-08:00","topics":["Equal Rights"],"countries":["China"],"category":"Citations","jurisdiction":"None","description":"Full Citation: Jacka, T., \"Increasing Women's Participation in Village Government in China: Is It Worth It?\" 40(4) CRITICAL ASIAN STUDIES 499 (2008).","author":"JMR","notes":"From China Office August 2012","first_name":null,"last_name":null,"paths":["/records/259"],"items":[{"title":"Increasing Women's Participation in Village Government in China: Is It Worth It? ","description":"ABSTRACT: In the last three decades in China, few and declining numbers of women have participated in the main grassroots institutions of rural government, the village committee and the village branch of the Chinese Communist Party. This article examines a project aimed at addressing this problem, initiated in 2003 in Heyang county, Shaanxi, by one of China’s largest and most influential women’s nongovernmental organizations, WestWomen, together with the state-affiliated Women’s Federation. The article discusses the goals, strategies, and short-term results of the Heyang Project. It then discusses the longer-term potential of the Heyang model for achieving greater gender equity and women’s empowerment in rural China. Previous studies have critiqued Chinese approaches to the goal of increasing women’s participation in village government, but have not questioned the desirability or need for the goal itself. In this article, the author takes the critique one step further, to provoke questions about the very desirability of increasing women’s participation in village government. She concludes that when viewed in light of other recent trends, notably large-scale rural out-migration and tax reforms, increasing women’s participation in village government may not have as desirable or significant an impact on gender relations as has previously been assumed. **As of Nov. 2012, this article is available for FREE at the link provided**","created_at":"2012-11-13T16:36:25.409-08:00","updated_at":"2018-01-11T13:32:02.023-08:00","url":"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14672710802505265","year":2008,"position":93,"published":true,"languages":["English"],"document":{"url":"/items/original/missing.png","filename":null,"content_type":null}}]},{"id":637,"title":"Citation Only: Cuba Housing Law","creator":"Republic of Cuba","published":true,"created_at":"2013-02-21T11:45:50.779-08:00","updated_at":"2015-07-25T17:13:08.303-07:00","topics":["Land \u0026 Property","Need Help Locating Full-Text"],"countries":["Cuba"],"category":"Legal Materials","jurisdiction":"National","description":"Currently, we do not have the full-text of this law.

In doing so, it echoes the policies the World Bank set out in its 2008 Policy Research Report on Finance. This paper offers a detailed analysis of these development policies and connects the current plans for the expansion of financial sectors in the developing world with policies that promote the acquisition of formal land title. The paper argues that as asset-backed lending expands, commercial banks will come to play an increasingly important role in third world economies. In light of this, it reviews important first-hand accounts of the difficulties of drafting legislation to protect women's access to land in the face of opposition from commercial lenders, using Tanzania and Uganda as illustrative examples. The paper assesses the implications of expanding access to credit for gender equality and concludes that it is difficult to reconcile the promotion of financial inclusion with the aim of international development to end poverty.","created_at":"2013-01-10T16:40:36.597-08:00","updated_at":"2018-01-11T13:32:02.023-08:00","url":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-2230.2010.00827.x/abstract","year":2010,"position":93,"published":true,"languages":["English"],"document":{"url":"/items/original/missing.png","filename":null,"content_type":null}}]},{"id":356,"title":"Tanzania Constitution","creator":"United Republic of Tanzania","published":true,"created_at":"2013-01-08T11:07:51.171-08:00","updated_at":"2014-11-26T17:55:13.147-08:00","topics":["Constitution"],"countries":["Tanzania"],"category":"Legal Materials","jurisdiction":"National","description":"","author":"Jmr","notes":"From Aisha, Leonard, \u0026 Jen C., December 2012","first_name":null,"last_name":null,"paths":["/records/356"],"items":[{"title":"Constitution of Tanzania, 1977 (rev. 1995)","description":"The source of this link is Constitute.

How far has land reform advanced in Tanzania, Mozambique, South Africa, Zimbabwe and Kenya? These are societies where, among the indigenous population, men have had primary land rights and women secondary derivative rights. How effectively has gender equality been implemented in their land reform policies? What problems need to be resolved, what are the forces resisting change and what remains to be done? This report from the University of Oslo and the Norwegian University of Life Sciences was commissioned by the Norwegian Agency of Development Cooperation. It adopted the human rights based approach (HRBA), to spell out a human rights framework for gender-equal and non-discriminatory land reform/formalisation processes. In traditional African societies there was no individual ownership of land. Unwritten customary law dispensed by male elders favoured men and discriminated against women. This affected rights to use of land, inheritance and the sharing of property following divorce. New Constitutions and statutory legislation have begun to change socio-legal and economic conditions for land users. A key issue in development policies, recognised by both neo-liberal approaches and the HRBA, is to establish, clarify and formalise land rights. The aim is to promote tenure security, land production and sustainable rural livelihoods, ensuring gender equality.","created_at":"2013-01-10T16:40:37.108-08:00","updated_at":"2018-01-11T13:32:02.023-08:00","url":"http://www.gsdrc.org/go/display/document/legacyid/1631","year":2005,"position":93,"published":true,"languages":["English"],"document":{"url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/landesa_production/resource/411/Ikdahl_Human-rights-formalisation-and-womens-land-rights-in-southern-and-eastern-africa_2005.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAICR3ICC22CMP7DPA\u0026Expires=1542754218\u0026Signature=B9Kchof5xGeS2dhjGzPx%2F1Ks9Zw%3D","filename":"Ikdahl_Human-rights-formalisation-and-womens-land-rights-in-southern-and-eastern-africa_2005.pdf","content_type":"application/pdf"}}]},{"id":380,"title":"Land Acquisitions for Agribusiness in Tanzania: Prospects and Challenges","creator":"Lawyers' Environmental Action Team (LEAT)","published":true,"created_at":"2013-01-10T16:40:37.183-08:00","updated_at":"2013-01-10T16:40:37.183-08:00","topics":["Land \u0026 Property"],"countries":["Tanzania"],"category":"Articles","jurisdiction":"None","description":"Full citation: LEAT, \"Land Acquisitions for Agribusiness in Tanzania: Prospects and Challenges,\" LEAT GENERAL PUBLICATION (2011).","author":"Jmr","notes":"Items identified from EOS by Jen C., January 2013","first_name":null,"last_name":null,"paths":["/records/380"],"items":[{"title":"Land Acquisitions for Agribusiness in Tanzania: Prospects and Challenges","description":"Summary: Includes study rationale and methodology; land acquisitions and agribusiness in Tanzania: a review of the literature; legal framework and the policy on land acquisition for agribusiness in Tanzania; acquisition of land for agribusiness in selected regions; emerging issues and way forward.","created_at":"2013-01-10T16:40:37.261-08:00","updated_at":"2018-01-11T13:32:02.023-08:00","url":"http://mokoro.co.uk/land-rights-article/land-acquisitions-for-agribusiness-in-tanzania-prospects-and-challenges/","year":2011,"position":93,"published":true,"languages":["English"],"document":{"url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/landesa_production/resource/412/LEAT_Land_acquisitions_for_agribusiness_in_Tanzania_2012.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAICR3ICC22CMP7DPA\u0026Expires=1542754218\u0026Signature=hUIqIoMfd%2Fu5AKxfo2642q25Rgs%3D","filename":"LEAT_Land_acquisitions_for_agribusiness_in_Tanzania_2012.pdf","content_type":"application/pdf"}}]},{"id":381,"title":"Legal Empowerment in Practice: Using Legal Tools to Secure Land Rights in Africa","creator":"Cotula, L. and Mathieu, P.","published":true,"created_at":"2013-01-10T16:40:37.434-08:00","updated_at":"2013-01-10T16:40:37.434-08:00","topics":["Land \u0026 Property"],"countries":["Uganda","Tanzania","Mozambique","South Africa","Zimbabwe","Democratic Republic of the Congo","Cameroon","Sierra Leone","Senegal","Mali","Multiple Countries"],"category":"Articles","jurisdiction":"None","description":"Full citation: Cotula, L. and Mathieu, P., \"Legal Empowerment in Practice: Using Legal Tools to Secure Land Rights in Africa,\" IIED \u0026 FAO REPORT (May 2008).","author":"Jmr","notes":"Items identified from EOS by Jen C., January 2013","first_name":null,"last_name":null,"paths":["/records/381"],"items":[{"title":"Legal Empowerment in Practice: Using Legal Tools to Secure Land Rights in Africa","description":"This report captures the highlights of the international lesson-sharing workshop “Legal empowerment for securing land rights”, which took place in Accra, Ghana, on 13th-14th March 2008.

It highlights key legal issues in efforts to improve women's access to land through the law, and provides a frank discussion of the author's involvement in translating constitutional, policy and legal provisions into detailed common law legislation that can be consistently implemented to achieve the goal of gender equality in land rights. The three cases discussed represent quite different situations: a relatively high degree of legal clarity and progressive policy and government support for gender equality in land rights in Rwanda; a highly politicised context in Tanzania, involving a struggle to even get women's land rights onto the agenda; and a more technically focused process in Uganda of trying to translate detailed pro-women provisions into practice, particularly with regard to mortgages. Common lessons emerge from all three cases, which are drawn together in the article's conclusion and which have wider application to the land reform processes that are now ongoing in other countries across the Eastern African region.","created_at":"2013-01-10T16:40:37.784-08:00","updated_at":"2018-01-11T13:32:02.023-08:00","url":"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17531050903556683#preview","year":2010,"position":93,"published":true,"languages":["English"],"document":{"url":"/items/original/missing.png","filename":null,"content_type":null}}]},{"id":383,"title":"Securing Land Rights for Women","creator":"Daley, E. and Englert, B.","published":true,"created_at":"2013-01-10T16:40:37.850-08:00","updated_at":"2013-01-10T16:40:37.850-08:00","topics":["Land \u0026 Property"],"countries":["Uganda","Rwanda","Tanzania","Ethiopia","Malawi","Multiple Countries"],"category":"Citations","jurisdiction":"None","description":"Full citation: Daley, E. and Englert, B., \"Securing Land Rights for Women\" 4(1) JOURNAL OF EASTERN AFRICAN STUDIES (2010).","author":"Jmr","notes":"Items identified from EOS by Jen C., January 2013","first_name":null,"last_name":null,"paths":["/records/383"],"items":[{"title":"Securing Land Rights for Women","description":"Abstract: This collection of papers on Securing Women's Land Rights presents five articles relating to eastern Africa. Four of these illustrate practical approaches to securing land rights for women in distinct situations: law-making for women's land rights (Rwanda, Tanzania and Uganda); land tenure reform in practice (Rwanda); women's rights under pastoral land tenure (Ethiopia); and women's rights in areas of matrilineal-matrilocal land tenure (Malawi). This article serves as an overall introduction to the subject, reviewing past issues and highlighting new ones, and setting out the shape of a positive, pragmatic approach to securing women's land rights in eastern Africa. Five key themes emerge: the role of customary institutions; the continuing central role of legislation as a foundation for changing custom; issues of gender equity and equitability, and underlying goals; the challenges of reform implementation and of growing women's confidence to claim their rights; and the importance of encouraging effective collaboration among all those working in the field of women's land rights. The article calls for a stronger focus on gender equity – on securing equal land rights for both women and men – in order to achieve sustainable positive change in broader social and political relations.","created_at":"2013-01-10T16:40:37.932-08:00","updated_at":"2018-01-11T13:32:02.023-08:00","url":"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17531050903556675#preview","year":2010,"position":93,"published":true,"languages":["English"],"document":{"url":"/items/original/missing.png","filename":null,"content_type":null}}]},{"id":531,"title":"Bermuda Wills Act","creator":"Government of Bermuda","published":true,"created_at":"2013-02-19T14:09:38.362-08:00","updated_at":"2014-12-17T12:05:57.568-08:00","topics":["Inheritance"],"countries":["Bermuda"],"category":"Legal Materials","jurisdiction":"National","description":"","author":"Jmr","notes":"From Fred Kaplan, February 2013.","first_name":null,"last_name":null,"paths":["/records/531"],"items":[{"title":"Wills Act of Bermuda","description":"","created_at":"2013-02-19T14:09:38.393-08:00","updated_at":"2018-01-11T13:32:02.023-08:00","url":"http://www.bermudalaws.bm/Laws/Consolidated%20Laws/Wills%20Act%201988.pdf","year":1988,"position":93,"published":true,"languages":["English"],"document":{"url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/landesa_production/resource/572/Bermuda_Wills-Act_1988_ENGLISH.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAICR3ICC22CMP7DPA\u0026Expires=1542754218\u0026Signature=Vl8yV9RVKPYWg765SpU6ewHg%2Biw%3D","filename":"Bermuda_Wills-Act_1988_ENGLISH.pdf","content_type":"application/pdf"}}]},{"id":530,"title":"Bermuda Succession Act","creator":"Government of Bermuda","published":true,"created_at":"2013-02-19T14:09:38.247-08:00","updated_at":"2014-12-17T12:06:16.338-08:00","topics":["Inheritance"],"countries":["Bermuda"],"category":"Legal Materials","jurisdiction":"National","description":"","author":"Jmr","notes":"From Fred Kaplan, February 2013.","first_name":null,"last_name":null,"paths":["/records/530"],"items":[{"title":"Succession Act of Bermuda","description":"","created_at":"2013-02-19T14:09:38.300-08:00","updated_at":"2018-01-11T13:32:02.023-08:00","url":"http://www.bermudalaws.bm/Laws/Consolidated%20Laws/Succession%20Act%201974.pdf","year":1974,"position":93,"published":true,"languages":["English"],"document":{"url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/landesa_production/resource/571/Bermuda_Succession-Act_1974.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAICR3ICC22CMP7DPA\u0026Expires=1542754218\u0026Signature=VvVhccjBssatHqG89ltwdcFy930%3D","filename":"Bermuda_Succession-Act_1974.pdf","content_type":"application/pdf"}}]},{"id":384,"title":"Securing Women's Interests within Land Tenure Reforms: Recent Debates in Tanzania","creator":"Tsikata, D.","published":true,"created_at":"2013-01-10T16:40:38.023-08:00","updated_at":"2013-01-10T16:40:38.023-08:00","topics":["Land \u0026 Property","Customary Practices","Land Reform"],"countries":["Tanzania"],"category":"Citations","jurisdiction":"None","description":"Full citation: Tsikata, D., \"Securing Women's Interests within Land Tenure Reforms: Recent Debates in Tanzania\" 3(1-2) JOURNAL OF AGRARIAN CHANGE (2003).","author":"Jmr","notes":"Items identified from EOS by Jen C., January 2013","first_name":null,"last_name":null,"paths":["/records/384"],"items":[{"title":"Securing Women's Interests within Land Tenure Reforms: Recent Debates in Tanzania","description":"Abstract: This article is an account of the debates around the recent land tenure reforms in Tanzania. It focuses on the discourses of Government officials, academic researchers and NGO activists on the implications of the reforms for women's interests in land and the most fruitful approaches to the issues of discriminatory customary law rules and male–dominated land management and adjudication institutions at national and village levels. The article argues that from being marginal to the debates, women's interests became one of the most contentious issues, showing up divisions within NGO ranks and generating accusations of State co–optation and class bias. It illustrates the implications of the recent positive reappraisal of African customary laws and local–level land management institutions for a specific national context, that of Tanzania.","created_at":"2013-01-10T16:40:38.166-08:00","updated_at":"2018-01-11T13:32:02.023-08:00","url":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1471-0366.00053/abstract","year":2003,"position":93,"published":true,"languages":["English"],"document":{"url":"/items/original/missing.png","filename":null,"content_type":null}}]},{"id":385,"title":"Statutory Recognition of Customary Land Rights in Africa: An Investigation into Best Practices for Lawmaking and Implementation","creator":"Knight, R.","published":true,"created_at":"2013-01-10T16:40:38.271-08:00","updated_at":"2013-01-10T16:40:38.271-08:00","topics":["Land \u0026 Property","Customary Practices"],"countries":["Tanzania","Mozambique","Botswana","Multiple Countries"],"category":"Articles","jurisdiction":"None","description":"Full citation: Knight, R., \"Statutory Recognition of Customary Land Rights in Africa: An Investigation into Best Practices for Lawmaking and Implementation\" 105 FAO LEGISLATIVE STUDY (2010).","author":"Jmr","notes":"Items identified from EOS by Jen C., January 2013","first_name":null,"last_name":null,"paths":["/records/385"],"items":[{"title":"Statutory Recognition of Customary Land Rights in Africa: An Investigation into Best Practices for Lawmaking and Implementation","description":"","created_at":"2013-01-10T16:40:38.357-08:00","updated_at":"2018-01-11T13:32:02.023-08:00","url":"http://www.fao.org/docrep/013/i1945e/i1945e00.htm","year":2010,"position":93,"published":true,"languages":["English"],"document":{"url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/landesa_production/resource/417/Knight_statutory-recognition-of-customary-land-rights-in-Africa_2010.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAICR3ICC22CMP7DPA\u0026Expires=1542754218\u0026Signature=lLYeCYkMJIyBLnt0hsvFJk2jT6g%3D","filename":"Knight_statutory-recognition-of-customary-land-rights-in-Africa_2010.pdf","content_type":"application/pdf"}}]},{"id":386,"title":"Two Faces of Change: The Need for a Bi-Directional Approach to Improve Women’s Land Rights in Plural Legal Systems","creator":"Kapur, A.","published":true,"created_at":"2013-01-10T16:40:38.437-08:00","updated_at":"2013-01-10T16:40:38.437-08:00","topics":["Land \u0026 Property","Marriage \u0026 Divorce","Inheritance","Widows","Land Reform","Customary Practices"],"countries":["Tanzania","Mozambique","Multiple Countries"],"category":"Articles","jurisdiction":"None","description":"Full citation: Kapur, A. \"Two Faces of Change: The Need for a Bi-Directional Approach to Improve Women’s Land Rights in Plural Legal Systems\" 4 IDLO WORKING PAPER SERIES (Leiden University 2011).","author":"Jmr","notes":"Items identified from EOS by Jen C., January 2013","first_name":null,"last_name":null,"paths":["/records/386"],"items":[{"title":"Two Faces of Change: The Need for a Bi-Directional Approach to Improve Women’s Land Rights in Plural Legal Systems","description":"Executive Summary:  The complex relationship between law, land rights and customary practices is increasingly recognized as foundational to formulating successful development policies. Similarly, the essential role of women’s economic participation in development and the current trend of gender discriminatory land and inheritance customary practices have prompted domestic civil society organizations in developing countries to use statutory provisions guaranteeing gender equality to improve women’s land tenure security. This chapter examines the particular need for secure land rights for women in the African pluralistic development context, and the mixed results of targeting law reform as a mechanism for change. Relying on primary research conducted in Mozambique and the United Republic of Tanzania on land practices as experienced by divorced and widowed women, it evaluates strategies employed by domestic non-governmental organizations to enhance women’s access to justice and land tenure security. In particular, the chapter analyses whether initiatives to disseminate and use statutory law (rather than customary law) are overcoming the lack of knowledge, application and enforcement that have previously limited the effectiveness of rights-affirming legislation. Specific and general conclusions are drawn from the data to generate recommendations for donors, governments and development institutions.","created_at":"2013-01-10T16:40:38.621-08:00","updated_at":"2018-01-11T13:32:02.023-08:00","url":"http://www.css.ethz.ch/en/services/digital-library/publications/publication.html/137090","year":2011,"position":93,"published":true,"languages":["English"],"document":{"url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/landesa_production/resource/418/Kapur_two-faces-of-change-the-need-for-a-bi-directional-approach_2011.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAICR3ICC22CMP7DPA\u0026Expires=1542754218\u0026Signature=K17tgk4Gu6pf3Qi3i%2F4iy2a%2BaRM%3D","filename":"Kapur_two-faces-of-change-the-need-for-a-bi-directional-approach_2011.pdf","content_type":"application/pdf"}}]},{"id":387,"title":"Understanding Land Investment Deals in Africa Country Report: Tanzania","creator":"Oakland Institute Researchers","published":true,"created_at":"2013-01-10T16:40:38.700-08:00","updated_at":"2013-01-10T16:40:38.700-08:00","topics":["Land \u0026 Property"],"countries":["Tanzania"],"category":"Articles","jurisdiction":"None","description":"Full citation: Oakland Institute Researchers, \"Understanding Land Investment Deals in Africa Country Report: Tanzania\" COUNTRY REPORTS (The Oakland Institute 2011).","author":"Jmr","notes":"Items identified from EOS by Jen C., January 2013","first_name":null,"last_name":null,"paths":["/records/387"],"items":[{"title":"Understanding Land Investment Deals in Africa Country Report: Tanzania","description":"","created_at":"2013-01-10T16:40:38.801-08:00","updated_at":"2018-01-11T13:32:02.023-08:00","url":"http://www.oaklandinstitute.org/publications","year":2011,"position":93,"published":true,"languages":["English"],"document":{"url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/landesa_production/resource/419/Oakland_Inst_Researchers_Understanding_land_investment_deals_in_Africa_Country_report_Tanzania_Dec_2011.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAICR3ICC22CMP7DPA\u0026Expires=1542754218\u0026Signature=Hvp12bT1GFmCOqLStHF0q%2BscLBI%3D","filename":"Oakland_Inst_Researchers_Understanding_land_investment_deals_in_Africa_Country_report_Tanzania_Dec_2011.pdf","content_type":"application/pdf"}}]},{"id":388,"title":"Women's Property and Inheritance Rights: Improving Lives in a Changing Time","creator":"Steinzor, N.","published":true,"created_at":"2013-01-10T16:40:38.957-08:00","updated_at":"2013-01-10T16:40:38.957-08:00","topics":["Land \u0026 Property","Inheritance"],"countries":["Tanzania","Kenya","Malawi","Namibia","Bangladesh","Cambodia","Nepal","Sri Lanka","Multiple Countries"],"category":"Articles","jurisdiction":"None","description":"Full citation: Steinzor, N., \"Women's Property and Inheritance Rights: Improving Lives in a Changing Time\" FINAL SYNTHESIS AND CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS PAPER (USAID and WIDtech 2003).","author":"Jmr","notes":"Items identified from EOS by Jen C., January 2013","first_name":null,"last_name":null,"paths":["/records/388"],"items":[{"title":"Women's Property and Inheritance Rights: Improving Lives in a Changing Time","description":"","created_at":"2013-01-10T16:40:39.045-08:00","updated_at":"2018-01-11T13:32:02.023-08:00","url":"http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNADA958.pdf","year":2003,"position":93,"published":true,"languages":["English"],"document":{"url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/landesa_production/resource/420/Steinzor_Women%E2%80%99s_Property_and_Inheritance_Rights_Improving_Lives_in_a_changing_time_2003.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAICR3ICC22CMP7DPA\u0026Expires=1542754218\u0026Signature=8dHp%2B9M99zTD9F291BsPmQrvPdA%3D","filename":"Steinzor_Women’s_Property_and_Inheritance_Rights_Improving_Lives_in_a_changing_time_2003.pdf","content_type":"application/pdf"}}]},{"id":456,"title":"Chile Constitution","creator":"Republic of Chile","published":true,"created_at":"2013-02-15T07:41:54.163-08:00","updated_at":"2014-11-19T18:29:45.132-08:00","topics":["Constitution"],"countries":["Chile"],"category":"Legal Materials","jurisdiction":"National","description":"","author":"Jmr","notes":"From Fred Kaplan, February 2013.","first_name":null,"last_name":null,"paths":["/records/456"],"items":[{"title":"Chile Constitution, 1980 (rev. 2014) [English]","description":"The source of this link is Constitute.

Rugadya] present[s] two key aspects of good practices and lessons learnt based on my experience in drafting Uganda’s national land policy and extensive experience as researcher and grant-maker in the East Africa region. The first aspect is that of content including agenda setting for policy and legislation – that specify which rights are accessible or open to women and how women attain them. The second aspect leans more to the policy drafting process on aspects of involvement, inclusion and participation of women and their representatives in the design, preparation and implementation of policy and legislation. To conclude I offer some thoughts on what the guidelines could do, to support the efforts of realising women’s rights to productive assets especially land.","created_at":"2013-01-23T15:33:18.688-08:00","updated_at":"2018-01-11T13:32:02.023-08:00","url":"","year":2012,"position":93,"published":true,"languages":["English"],"document":{"url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/landesa_production/resource/461/Rugadya_Womens-rights-to-productive-assets-lessons-learnt-from-Uganda_2012.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAICR3ICC22CMP7DPA\u0026Expires=1542754218\u0026Signature=NYAFvetf6icct5CIGCczz4eUUqs%3D","filename":"Rugadya_Womens-rights-to-productive-assets-lessons-learnt-from-Uganda_2012.pdf","content_type":"application/pdf"}}]},{"id":458,"title":"Colombia Constitution","creator":"Republic of Colombia","published":true,"created_at":"2013-02-15T07:41:55.189-08:00","updated_at":"2014-11-19T18:37:13.176-08:00","topics":["Constitution"],"countries":["Colombia"],"category":"Legal Materials","jurisdiction":"National","description":"","author":"Jmr","notes":"From Fred Kaplan, February 2013.","first_name":null,"last_name":null,"paths":["/records/458"],"items":[{"title":"Constitution of Colombia, 1991 (rev. 2015) [English]","description":"Colombia's Constitution of 1991 with Amendments through 2015\r\n","created_at":"2017-11-22T17:43:08.751-08:00","updated_at":"2017-11-22T17:44:15.976-08:00","url":"https://www.constituteproject.org/constitution/Colombia_2015.pdf?lang=en","year":2015,"position":1,"published":true,"languages":["English"],"document":{"url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/landesa_production/resource/3141/Colombia_Constitution_2015_ENGLISH.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAICR3ICC22CMP7DPA\u0026Expires=1542754218\u0026Signature=HtSynSsXHno91I2aDzd%2FjDN0%2B7M%3D","filename":"Colombia_Constitution_2015_ENGLISH.pdf","content_type":"application/pdf"}},{"title":"Constitution of Colombia [English]","description":"The source for this link is Richmond University.","created_at":"2013-02-15T08:59:54.410-08:00","updated_at":"2018-01-11T13:32:02.023-08:00","url":"http://confinder.richmond.edu/admin/docs/colombia_const2.pdf","year":1991,"position":2,"published":true,"languages":["English"],"document":{"url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/landesa_production/resource/510/Colombia_Constitution_1991_ENGLISH.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAICR3ICC22CMP7DPA\u0026Expires=1542754218\u0026Signature=IUvXHZ2N1Cojl0GFpK%2BjCcU8YLo%3D","filename":"Colombia_Constitution_1991_ENGLISH.pdf","content_type":"application/pdf"}},{"title":"Constitution of Colombia, 1991 (rev. 2013) [English]","description":"The source of this link is Constitute.

This process is seen to be occurring even without state protection of private land rights, through titling. Gender as an analytical category is excluded in evolutionary models. Women are accommodated only in their dependent position as the wives of landholders in idealized “households”. This paper argues that gender relations are central to the organization and transformation of landholding systems. Women have faced different forms of tenure insecurity, both as wives and in their relations with wider kin, as landholding systems have been integrated into wider markets. These cannot be addressed when evolutionary models dominate the policy debate.

In the first part acknowledgement of influencing context conditions that refine gender issues are detailed these include; the nature of women’s rights, position of women given their transient rights, the consequences of gender inequality on land and the effect of dispute resolution on land matters. The economic efficiency and equity theory together with the human rights discourse have provided a firm foundation for negotiating and demanding for women’s rights in national policy, which has either had to make choice between options or promote concurrent ideologies to accommodate evidence based demands to tackle two key issues; access to land and control of land (including its outputs) through adaptation of tenure and legal dualism, making a choice between representation, participant or professionalism in land management and purchase or inheritance under customary or registered tenure. This paper concludes by outlining key implications of gender for PSIA data collection and ex-post analysis, as well as implications for systematic demarcation projects.","created_at":"2013-02-05T14:19:58.531-08:00","updated_at":"2018-01-11T13:32:02.023-08:00","url":"http://mokoro.co.uk/land-rights-article/gender-in-ugandas-national-land-policy/","year":2007,"position":93,"published":true,"languages":["English"],"document":{"url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/landesa_production/resource/479/Rugadya_Gender-in-uganda-national-land-policy_2007.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAICR3ICC22CMP7DPA\u0026Expires=1542754219\u0026Signature=6PYGWy55ExVO%2FMvbh%2FDBdC5%2Fuow%3D","filename":"Rugadya_Gender-in-uganda-national-land-policy_2007.pdf","content_type":"application/pdf"}}]},{"id":444,"title":"Gender Monitoring Baseline Survey for the Land Sector Strategic Plan in 20 Districts ","creator":"Associates for Development (AfD) and Centre for Basic Research","published":true,"created_at":"2013-02-05T14:19:58.630-08:00","updated_at":"2013-02-05T14:19:58.630-08:00","topics":["Land \u0026 Property"],"countries":["Uganda"],"category":"Articles","jurisdiction":"None","description":"Full citation: Associates for Development \u0026 Centre for Basic Research, \"MGender Monitoring Baseline Survey for the Land Sector Strategic Plan in 20 Districts,\" (March 2006).","author":"Jmr","notes":"R.

However, the scale of HIV infection rates, stigmatisation, and the social and economic vulnerability of widows and orphans have worsened the situation. Targets of psychological and physical harassment, dispossessed of their property and evicted form their homes, women and children are left destitute. Too often, the personal stories of both hardship and resilience in the face of adversity are lost in the statistics and dry overviews of national policies and epidemiological trends. Excluded from statistics, these women and children become invisible. This collection of narratives from southern and East Africa aims to raise awareness not only about the heavy impact of HIV and AIDS in the region but also about the active steps being taken by many grassroots organizations to respond to the crisis. It is evident that, while the pandemic is biting deeply into the social fabric of communities, it is also galvanising ordinary women and men to respond with compassion and conviction, and to find innovative ways of defending and promoting the rights of HIV-affected women and children. These stories expose the immense human cost of discriminatory laws and practices, and pointing to the social, policy and legislative changes that are necessary to combat the pandemic effectively.","created_at":"2013-02-26T10:17:32.755-08:00","updated_at":"2018-05-22T13:52:34.925-07:00","url":"","year":2006,"position":93,"published":true,"languages":["English"],"document":{"url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/landesa_production/resource/716/FAO_Reclaiming-our-lives-HIV-and-AIDS-womens-land-and-property-rights_2006.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAICR3ICC22CMP7DPA\u0026Expires=1542754219\u0026Signature=viuyYOr8xctpmJqXfvi1JURMXo0%3D","filename":"FAO_Reclaiming-our-lives-HIV-and-AIDS-womens-land-and-property-rights_2006.pdf","content_type":"application/pdf"}}]},{"id":667,"title":"Good Practices and Lessons Learned in the Realization of Women's Rights to Land as a Productive Resource: A Focus on Kenya","creator":"Gatundu, C.","published":true,"created_at":"2013-02-26T10:17:32.802-08:00","updated_at":"2013-02-26T10:17:32.802-08:00","topics":["Land \u0026 Property","Land Reform"],"countries":["Kenya"],"category":"Articles","jurisdiction":"None","description":"Full citation: Gatundu, C., \"Good Practices and Lessons Learned in the Realization of Women's Rights to Land as a Productive Resource: A Focus on Kenya,\" UN WOMEN EXPERT PAPER (Geneva, June 2012).","author":"Jmr","notes":"R.

In Mozambique coexist two different kinship systems, one patrilineal system in force in Southern Mozambique and one matrilineal in parts of the centre and North. The paper argues that in the current context, the right of women to access and administer land is being limited not so much by traditional and customary social rules and law, but rather by the adverse socioeconomic context which characterizes the whole peasant sector. On the other, data confirm that in spite of the appearance of several progressive laws in recent years, which include measures to promote gender equality and reinforce women rights through the overturning of discriminatory social practices, the guarantee and “de facto” exercising of their rights by women is still conditioned by the social role as a mother or wife, and not as an individual with rights “per se.”","created_at":"2013-02-26T10:17:33.773-08:00","updated_at":"2018-01-11T13:32:02.023-08:00","url":"","year":2011,"position":93,"published":true,"languages":["English"],"document":{"url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/landesa_production/resource/722/Villanueva_The-big-picture-land-and-gender-issues-in-matrilineal-mozambique_2011.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAICR3ICC22CMP7DPA\u0026Expires=1542754219\u0026Signature=fzznHyi3ccHZuYRETao1JP0Bu5Y%3D","filename":"Villanueva_The-big-picture-land-and-gender-issues-in-matrilineal-mozambique_2011.pdf","content_type":"application/pdf"}}]},{"id":673,"title":"Law Reforms Which Promote Women's Rights to Land and Property: Developments and Proposals in Namibia","creator":"Hubbard, D.","published":true,"created_at":"2013-02-26T10:17:33.810-08:00","updated_at":"2013-02-26T10:17:33.810-08:00","topics":["Land \u0026 Property","Widows","Customary Practices"],"countries":["Namibia"],"category":"Articles","jurisdiction":"None","description":"Full citation: Hubbard, D., \"Law Reforms Which Promote Women's Rights to Land and Property: Developments and Proposals in Namibia,\"  UN WOMEN EXPERT PAPER (Geneva, June 2012).","author":"Jmr","notes":"R.

Within this reality, a groundbreaking study was commissioned to investigate the land and property rights of women and orphans in Zimbabwe in the context of HIV/AIDS. It also examines the coping strategies, in terms of land-related livelihoods, adopted by widows and other vulnerable women affected by the pandemic. Providing revealing empirical evidence and new insights based on interviews with key informants, focus group discussions and a semi-structured interview questionnaire, the study is framed around four Zimbabwean sites located in communal, resettlement and urban areas Buhera, Bulawayo, Chimanimani and Seke. The research critically examines Zimbabwe's land and agriculture policies, and the utilization and efficacy of legal redress. It suggests and develops policy responses to cushion the impact of HIV/AIDS on local communities, especially dispossessed women. While confirming the vulnerability of widows and other categories of poor and vulnerable women and children to property rights violation, the study also analyses the critical roles played by women in establishing and managing urban and rural support initiatives.","created_at":"2013-02-26T10:17:34.246-08:00","updated_at":"2018-05-22T13:50:24.036-07:00","url":"","year":2006,"position":93,"published":true,"languages":["English"],"document":{"url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/landesa_production/resource/726/FAO_Land-and-property-rights-of-women-and-orphans-in-context-of-HIV-AIDS-Zimbabwe_2006.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAICR3ICC22CMP7DPA\u0026Expires=1542754219\u0026Signature=gAdSiwFSRDm%2Fn0raoc2eZhuqqio%3D","filename":"FAO_Land-and-property-rights-of-women-and-orphans-in-context-of-HIV-AIDS-Zimbabwe_2006.pdf","content_type":"application/pdf"}}]},{"id":731,"title":"Bhutan Land Act","creator":"Royal Government of Bhutan","published":true,"created_at":"2013-03-22T12:56:03.732-07:00","updated_at":"2014-12-17T12:11:24.809-08:00","topics":["Land \u0026 Property"],"countries":["Bhutan"],"category":"Legal Materials","jurisdiction":"National","description":"","author":"Jmr","notes":"From Daniel Ajema, March 2013.","first_name":null,"last_name":null,"paths":["/records/731"],"items":[{"title":"Land Act of Bhutan, 2007","description":"","created_at":"2013-03-22T12:56:03.897-07:00","updated_at":"2018-01-11T13:32:02.023-08:00","url":"http://www.nationalcouncil.bt/business/acts","year":2007,"position":93,"published":true,"languages":["English"],"document":{"url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/landesa_production/resource/781/Bhutan_Land-Act-of-Bhutan_2007.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAICR3ICC22CMP7DPA\u0026Expires=1542754219\u0026Signature=cYWQmDW9p2ZpNGlOWain9ctZHXE%3D","filename":"Bhutan_Land-Act-of-Bhutan_2007.pdf","content_type":"application/pdf"}}]},{"id":730,"title":"Bhutan Inheritance Act","creator":"Royal Government of Bhutan","published":true,"created_at":"2013-03-22T12:56:03.456-07:00","updated_at":"2014-12-17T12:11:53.258-08:00","topics":["Inheritance"],"countries":["Bhutan"],"category":"Legal Materials","jurisdiction":"National","description":"","author":"Jmr","notes":"From Daniel Ajema, March 2013.","first_name":null,"last_name":null,"paths":["/records/730"],"items":[{"title":"Inheritance Act of the Bhutanese Iron Monkey Year, corresponding to the year 1980","description":"","created_at":"2013-03-22T12:56:03.543-07:00","updated_at":"2018-01-11T13:32:02.023-08:00","url":"http://www.nationalcouncil.bt/business/acts","year":1980,"position":93,"published":true,"languages":["English"],"document":{"url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/landesa_production/resource/780/Bhutan_Inheritance-Act_1980.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAICR3ICC22CMP7DPA\u0026Expires=1542754219\u0026Signature=Icn7akVhahw9516wNTJX6vN7WB0%3D","filename":"Bhutan_Inheritance-Act_1980.pdf","content_type":"application/pdf"}}]},{"id":686,"title":"Cultivating Women’s Rights for Access to Land ","creator":"Hatcher, J., Meggiolaro, L. and Ferrer, C.S.","published":true,"created_at":"2013-02-28T14:29:04.266-08:00","updated_at":"2013-02-28T14:37:55.236-08:00","topics":["Land \u0026 Property","Land Reform","Customary Practices"],"countries":["Uganda","Ghana","Mozambique","Ethiopia","Malawi","Bangladesh","Guatemala","Afghanistan","Burkina Faso","Vietnam","Multiple Countries"],"category":"Citations","jurisdiction":"None","description":"Full citation: Hatcher, J., Meggiolaro, L. and Ferrer, C.S., \"Cultivating Women's Rights for Access to Land,\"  ACTIONAID AND INTERNATIONAL FOOD SECURITY NETWORK COUNTRY ANALYSIS REPORT (October 2005).","author":"Jmr","notes":"R.

In line with this, our paper analyzes the impact of land certification on boosting productivity of female-headed households in Ethiopia, which are believed to be systematically more tenure insecure than their male counterparts. Based on parametric and semi-parametric analyses, the impact of certification on plot-level productivity is positive and significant. However, certification has different impacts on male and female productivity: male-headed households gain significantly and women gain only modestly. Hence, the results indicate that, while certification is clearly beneficial to farm-level productivity, it does not necessarily lead to more gains for female-headed households.","created_at":"2013-03-02T22:21:02.102-08:00","updated_at":"2018-01-11T13:32:02.023-08:00","url":"http://www.rff.org/Documents/EfD-DP-10-23.pdf","year":2010,"position":93,"published":true,"languages":["English"],"document":{"url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/landesa_production/resource/757/Bezabih_Role-of-land-certification-in-reducing-gender-gaps-in-productivity-in-rural-ethiopia_2010.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAICR3ICC22CMP7DPA\u0026Expires=1542754219\u0026Signature=NROEd0rM1ui20WFVScq9ptcnZq8%3D","filename":"Bezabih_Role-of-land-certification-in-reducing-gender-gaps-in-productivity-in-rural-ethiopia_2010.pdf","content_type":"application/pdf"}}]},{"id":708,"title":"Study on Women's Property Rights in Afar and Oromiya Regions, Ethiopia","creator":"Flintan, F., Demlie, S.

I draw data from Ghana and exploit the variation in the degree of asymmetric information between spouses, measured as the difference between the husband’s own reporting of farm sales and the wife’s reporting of his farm sales, to test whether the allocation of resources is consistent with hiding. Findings indicate that allocations are suggestive of men hiding farm sales income in the form of gifts to extended family members.\r\n","created_at":"2013-03-06T11:28:11.910-08:00","updated_at":"2018-01-11T13:32:02.023-08:00","url":"http://www.wider.unu.edu/publications/working-papers/2013/en_GB/wp2013-007/","year":2013,"position":93,"published":true,"languages":["English"],"document":{"url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/landesa_production/resource/765/Castilla_Ties-that-bind-the-kin-system-as-a-mechanism-of-income-hiding-between-spouses-in-rural-ghana_2013.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAICR3ICC22CMP7DPA\u0026Expires=1542754219\u0026Signature=MrZBfD7h9xKKofFh4p%2F4tyhhC5I%3D","filename":"Castilla_Ties-that-bind-the-kin-system-as-a-mechanism-of-income-hiding-between-spouses-in-rural-ghana_2013.pdf","content_type":"application/pdf"}}]},{"id":719,"title":"Armenia Constitution","creator":"Republic of Armenia","published":true,"created_at":"2013-03-22T12:56:00.536-07:00","updated_at":"2014-11-11T15:38:26.395-08:00","topics":["Constitution"],"countries":["Armenia"],"category":"Legal Materials","jurisdiction":"National","description":"","author":"Jmr","notes":"From Daniel Ajema, March 2013.","first_name":null,"last_name":null,"paths":["/records/719"],"items":[{"title":"Constitution of Armenia, 1995 (rev. 2005)","description":"The source of this link is Constitute.

These countries represent geographic diversity and demonstrate rich differences in context, legal practices, and cultural norms.

It concludes that separate property provides women with the most power and control over their own land, but that compulsory joint ownership in formal law for married women or for women living in consensual unions provides women with some protection against being left without land or a home when her relationship with her husband breaks down either due to divorce, abandonment, polygamy, or death. Women’s rights to land and other immovable property within different tenure structures varies considerably depending on family and lineage structures, the strength of customary norms and practices, observed and enforced legislation, and active organization on the part of women, and customary norms and practices seem to exclude women from enjoying property rights with the exception of some matrilineal societies and some family tenure forms.

Highlight the multitude of issues and challenges facing African women in relation to land and property. 2. Document the main strategies that grassroots women’s groups are using to help women attain justice, either by working within or influencing customary legal frameworks, or by assisting women to access the court system, in order to develop a cohesive series of strategies for grassroots women-led groups to use in achieving justice in relation to land and property. 3.

The first phase involved interviewing focus groups and key informants about assets held by men and women in the communities and on patterns of acquisition and social norms surrounding asset ownership and inheritance. The second phase was a household and intra-household survey. Life-history interviews were also conducted. The study found that many women gain access to land or ownership through their marital relationships. Both husbands and wives often indicate that land is owned jointly. However, rights over land differ for men and women, with women having fewer rights than men.  Women do inherit land, both from their fathers and from their husbands, although it is much more common for men to inherit land. While women may successfully access land through their husbands, and may even claim ownership, these rights frequently depend on the stability of the marriage. Under most customary systems, a widow can claim land that belonged to her husband only if she has a son. The land will be inherited by the son, and the mother can continue to farm it until the son is grown-up and can claim it. Women without sons are at risk of losing access to the land, depending on their relationships with their husband’s family and the community. In spite of this arrangement, some widows have been able to maintain independent claims on land.

Specifically, the analysis finds (among other things) impacts of the land registration effort on the evolution of perceptions of the distribution of assets upon divorce. The study found that awareness about the land registration process is positively correlated with the shift in perceptions toward equal division of land and livestock upon divorce, particularly for wives in male-headed households. The presence of female members in the Land Administration Committee also had a positive effect on the shift in perceptions toward a more equal distribution of assets upon divorce.

One finding is that women may accumulate property in two ways, as individual property and as community property. While individual property, generally acquired through an inheritance, provides a fall back position, community property in marriage or unions has special benefits.

It analyzes how different definitions of land ownership – including household reports, existence of ownership documents, and rights over the land – provide very different indications of the gendered patterns of land ownership and rights. While many households report husbands and wives as joint owners of the land, women are less likely to be listed on ownership documents, and have fewer rights.

It finds that property rights increase women’s participation in decision making, access to knowledge and information about public matters, sense of security, self-esteem, and the respect that they receive from their spouses. Women display a higher attachment to their houses than men, especially after getting joint titles, because houses play a valuable role in fulfilling women’s practical and strategic gender needs. This increased attachment to the house helps reduce property turnover in regularized settlements, hence assisting the government in attainingits goals and making joint titling a win-win policy.

Focus group discussions in India and Nepal showed that widows who were a part of this collaborative effort were more articulate, confident and aware of their rights. This played an important role in helping them claim their entitlements, including land rights. In Sri Lanka, widows have been able to take advantage of government programs for capacity building and skills training due to the partnership between the government and the groups working with widows. In the process, many widows have become agents of change in their community.

These efforts include both the creation of institutional linkages as well as community-based activities. One issue has been the position of women under customary law, and especially the fact that widows often have no rights to their deceased husbands’ lands. At a workshop, the traditional leaders present unanimously decided that widows should not be chased from their lands or out of their homes and that they should not be asked to pay again for the land. The president of the country was also a proponent of the change. This research found that this statement led to positive change.

(2014). “Learning from a ‘paralegals’ intervention to support women’s property rights in Uganda.” ICRW. - This paper analyzes an ICRW and Uganda Land Alliance program to establish and build the capacity of a legal rights worker organization in Luwero District, Uganda. The program aimed to support women’s property rights by training a group of male and female community members to become legal rights workers. Referred to as “paralegals”, these legal rights workers provide legal advice, mediation services, and education about WPR and other property rights issues to people in their communities. It found that targeted sensitization messages help to support the intensity and reach of community education efforts on women’s property rights, that two levels of training and technical support for paralegals have been critical: 1) formal, structured trainings on the law and women’s property rights; and 2) ongoing, more personalized assistance on handling property rights disputes/cases and delivering sensitization messages on women’s property rights, that strengthening relationships with local leaders and institutions — whether with local councilpersons, religious leaders, or law enforcement bodies — is critical for the successful implementation of a community-based legal aid program that aims to strengthen women’s property rights, and that implementing a comprehensive monitoring and evaluation system enabled the program to identify challenges and formulate new approaches will help increase its effectiveness.

(2013). “The paradox of gender discrimination in land ownership and women's contribution to poverty reduction in Anglophone Cameroon.” GeoJournal, 78(3), 575-589. - This study adopted a method of field work involving observations, the use of questionnaires, interviews, and focus group discussions for data collection that was able to capture key issues related to women, culture and land. The sample size of 2,205 participants included 80 % women and 20 % men from all socio-economic, political, demographic and ethnic groups. In addition to this sample, interviews were conducted and focus-group discussions held with key women, human rights NGOs and, traditional and administrative authorities in each of the localities.\r\n \r\nThe study found that land is an important factor of production for both men and women in predominantly agrarian Cameroon. While the legal framework in Cameroon advocates for equal rights and opportunities to resources, the majority of rural women who are mostly peasant farmers can neither inherit nor own land due to gender discriminatory customary practices. The findings revealed that although women are key players in the struggle against poverty who depend solely on land, they still do not have security of tenure over the land they cultivate.  Specifically, land inheritance is one of the areas in which gender discrimination is still prevalent. It is deeply rooted in the socio-cultural practices of both patrilineal and matrilineal societies. In matrilineal communities like Aghen and part of Kom, where inheritance follows the female linage, the sons, and not the daughters of this linage have inheritance rights. Field investigation indicates that men and women are unanimous on the fact that current practices discriminate against women.

It finds that while female-dominated groups tend to have more property rights to trees and bushes, and collect more fuelwood but less timber than do male-dominated or gender-balanced groups, gender-balanced groups participate more in forestry decision-making and are more likely to have exclusive use of forests. Female-dominated groups participate less, sanction less, and exclude less. It’s therefore important to gain better understanding of the dynamics of mixed-gender groups, including the nature and types of cooperation among males and females when determining what kind of group-based intervention to pursue.

It found that while the difference between male- and female-headed households’ proportions of land registered is small, there is a “glaring” gap in men’s and women’s knowledge of land rights and that educating women had significant impact on soil conservation. Using the 2009 round of the Ethiopian Rural Household Survey, the paper examines the medium-term impact of the land registration on investment behavior by households, particularly the adoption of soil conservation techniques and tree planting. The paper suggests that closing the knowledge gap in legal rights is an important step to improving adoption of soil conservation technologies and sustainable farming techniques.

(2014). “Women’s Land Rights and Children’s Human Capital in Vietnam.” World Development, 54, 18-31. - Vietnam’s 1993 Land Law created a land market by granting households land-use rights which could be exchanged, leased, and mortgaged. Using a matched household sample from Vietnam’s 2004 and 2008 Household Living Standards Survey, this study analyzes whether land titling for women led to improvements in child health and education. Results from the land market indicate that female-only held land-use rights decreased the incidence of illness among children, increased their health insurance coverage, raised school enrollment, and reallocated household expenditures toward food and away from alcohol and tobacco. These effects were almost all stronger than in households with male-only or jointly-held land-use rights.\r\n[Threats to Women’s Land Tenure Security and Effectiveness of Interventions - Annotated Bibliography]","author":"Jmr","notes":"From AR's Bibliography, July 2016","first_name":null,"last_name":null,"paths":["/records/2744"],"items":[{"title":"Women’s Land Rights and Children’s Human Capital in Vietnam","description":"\r\n","created_at":"2016-07-29T12:43:43.968-07:00","updated_at":"2018-01-11T13:32:02.023-08:00","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305750X13001745","year":2014,"position":95,"published":true,"languages":["English"],"document":{"url":"/items/original/missing.png","filename":null,"content_type":null}}]},{"id":2955,"title":"Strengthening Women's Land Rights in Northern Uganda","creator":"Fletschner, D. \u0026 Kamusiime, H.","published":true,"created_at":"2018-03-08T15:06:09.460-08:00","updated_at":"2018-03-08T15:06:09.460-08:00","topics":["Gender Equality"],"countries":["Uganda"],"category":"Articles","jurisdiction":"National","description":"Twelve-month project assessment report","author":"JCC","notes":"Added by request of Amanda R","first_name":null,"last_name":null,"paths":["/records/2955"],"items":[{"title":"Strengthening Women's Land Rights in Northern Uganda","description":"Decades of conflict, community resettlements, co-existing customary and statutory systems, and high demand for land in Northern Uganda have turned access to and control over land into a very contentious issue, affecting which land rights are granted, to whom, and how secure these rights are. Women, and especially women without a male relative to support them, often find themselves in a particularly vulnerable position.  \r\nTo address these problems, Landesa partnered with local organizations WORUDET and ARUL to develop and pilot an approach that relies on in-country institutional capacity to strengthen women’s land rights in a customary, post-conflict setting. The pilot worked at three levels: community-based facilitators, groups of local women, and community leaders. \r\nTwelve months after the project’s launch, this mixed-methods assessment reports noticeable improvements in women’s perceptions of their rights to land. More specifically, women report accessing more land; they indicate that their rights are more likely to be recognized by their families and their communities; they believe their rights are less vulnerable to changes in their families and their communities; they report being more likely to enforce their rights to land; and they perceive themselves as more likely to effectively influence their families’ decisions to sell, rent, mortgage or bequeath land.

(2013). “Improving Access to Land and Strengthening Women's land rights in Africa.” World Bank. - The need to improve access to land and strengthen women's land rights in Africa has elicited a lot of discussion with women's rights activists arguing for increased access and control over land and other productive resources. The paper examines inter-relations between women’s land rights and socio- economic development, peace and security and environmental sustainability in Africa. It goes on to highlight the impacts of the discrimination against women with regard to access, control and ownership of land and identifies promising practices related to strengthening women’s land rights with possible benchmarks and indicators to track progress made in strengthening women’s land rights in the context of the implementation of the AU Declaration on land. It concludes by providing concrete recommendations on how to further promote dialogue, advocacy, partnerships and capacity development in support of women’s land rights in Africa. This paper is as a result of a study commissioned by AU-ECA-AfDB Land Policy Initiative (LPI) which is implementing a 5- year Strategic Plan and Roadmap to assist member states in the implementation of the AU Declaration on land issues and challenges in Africa, in accordance with the Framework and Guidelines on Land Policy in Africa in order to achieve socio-economic development, peace and security, and environmental sustainability.

(2008). Gender, social capital and information exchange in rural Uganda. J. Int. Dev., 20: 35–52. - Established social structures, such as grassroots associations, have contributed to efforts at agricultural development in rural areas. By disaggregating the analysis by the gender of the household head, the study provides a detailed assessment of how differences among male and female heads of households influence information diffusion in rural areas. Results support the premise that social capital significantly influences information exchange among rural households, with evidence of gender disparities in the process. Female heads of households appear to be disadvantaged in their access to information related to agricultural technologies. Local associations have a higher effect among female heads of households while social institutions have a higher effect among male heads of households. An important implication from this result for outreach programs is that different forms of social capital may need to be accounted for in development programs. The results provide support for group-based approaches in technology dissemination. Since both male and female heads of household have the same propensity to join associations, this type of social capital should be encouraged. Strategies that promote gender heterogeneous groups may have a greater impact on information diffusion. Formal extension activity in the village stimulates information exchange, particularly among women that head households.\r\n \r\nFinally, the direction of information exchange is also of policy relevance. Both informal and formal mechanisms for information dissemination appear to have a significant impact on a two-way information sharing. This warrants support for formal extension programs and community associations as two complementary mechanisms for information diffusion in rural areas.

Collective action is analysed for the core variables of reputation, trust and reciprocity. In the tribal institutions, traditional seed exchange rests on reputation and gender complementarities, which are eroded by a diminishing degree of trust and dissolving property rights for women and weakened by failing norms of reciprocity. The new institution of PBR threatens tribal women’s reputations and their knowledge by reducing it to a bureaucratic register, the disembodiment of knowledge into information reduces trust and unpredictable returns diminish reciprocity. A massive public investment in strengthening women’s capabilities for a transformation from conservers and users to advocates, managers and decision-makers regarding biodiversity might halt the loss.

It focuses on whether varying proportions of women (low, mixed, high) in forest user groups influence their likelihood of adopting forest resource enhancing behavior and finds that higher proportions of females in user groups, and especially user groups dominated by females, perform less well than mixed groups or male dominated ones. This may be because of gender biases in technology access and dissemination, a labor constraint faced by women, and/or a possible limitation to women’s sanctioning authority. Mixed female and male groups offer an avenue for exploiting the strengths of women and men, while tempering their individual shortcomings.

The initial interviews were structured and conducted with various groups and individuals.\r\n \r\nIn Kenya, government efforts at establishing clearly defined property rights and adjudication mechanisms have run up against alternative processes for the adjudication of disputes. This research demonstrates that customary processes may also carry a monetary cost that puts them beyond the means of many citizens. This article compares the costs and processes of the formal and informal methods of property rights adjudication for women in the Kisii region of Kenya. The research results suggest that women have weak property rights overall, they have limited access to formal dispute resolution systems because of costs involved, and even the informal systems of conflict resolution are beyond the means of many citizens.\r\n \r\nAttempts to maintain use rights over their land when widowed or divorced are not taken to the land tribunals because of the expense involved.

Many scholars have documented systems of land exchange between husbands and wives for services rendered within the context of cocoa farming. This study shows that new and previously undocumented forms of informal conjugal unions may be coming into existence in the context of cocoa production, and these new arrangements provide much less land tenure security for women.\r\n \r\nIn the matrilineal communities especially, formal marriage arrangements appear to be an exception rather than the prevailing norm. Contract marriages, popular in the western region, are essentially seasonal arrangements made between men and women particularly during the cocoa harvesting season, which lasts for a period of three to six months, after which the relationship is either renewed or terminated. No land is exchanged in a contract marriage. Consensual unions are not as secure as formal marriages, but are a step toward formal marriage.  In one case, the Ghanaian court said women in such relationships were entitled to a one-third share of cocoa land which they had assisted their partners to develop.

Most of the credit for raising the issue of women's land rights rests with women within the rural unions, as a by–product of the effort to end discrimination against women in all its dimensions. The achievement of formal equality in land rights did not lead to increases in the share of female beneficiaries of the reform, which remained low in the mid–1990s. This was largely because securing women's land rights in practice was not a top priority of any of the rural social movements. Moreover, the main social movement determining the pace of the agrarian reform, the landless movement, considered class and gender issues to be incompatible. By the late 1990s, however, there was growing awareness that failure to recognize women's land rights was prejudicial to the development and consolidation of the agrarian reform settlements and thus the movement. The growing consensus among all the rural social movements of the importance of securing women's land rights, coupled with effective lobbying, encouraged the State in 2001 to adopt specific mechanisms for the inclusion of women in the agrarian reform.

Chapter 4 in particular focuses on efforts to improve tenure security. One study in India examines whether changes in inheritance legislation impact the socioeconomic status of females, and found that when daughters were granted coparcenary birthrights in joint family property denied to daughters in the past, the amendment significantly increased the probability of females inheriting land. However, even after the passage of the amendment, significant bias against females persists. Another study in Ethiopia assesses the effects on the allocative efficiency of the land rental market of the low-cost approach to land registration and certification of restricted property rights that were implemented in Ethiopia from the late 1990s. Four rounds of balanced household panel data collected from 16 villages in northern Ethiopia are used. After controlling for endogeneity of land certification and unobserved household heterogeneity affecting land market participation, it was found that land certification enhanced land rental market participation of female landlord households.

It examines women's participation relative to men and the challenges and successes they experience. The review shows that agroforestry has the potential to offer substantial benefits to women; however, their participation is low in enterprises that are considered men's domain, such as timber and high in enterprises that have little or no commercial value, such as collection of indigenous fruits and vegetables. Data on whether women are able to manage agroforestry practices as well as men are mixed, although it is clear that women do most of the work. In cases where they do not perform well, the reasons are mostly due to scarcity of resources. In marketing, women are confined to the lower end of the value chain (retailing), which limits their control over and returns from the productive process. In order to promote gender equity in agroforestry and to ensure that women benefit fully, the paper recommends various policy, technological and institutional interventions.

(2003). “The gender asset gap: land in Latin America.” World Development, 31 (6), pp 925-947. - The gender asset gap in Latin America with respect to ownership of land is significant. In few countries do women constitute even one-quarter of the landowners. Gender inequality in land ownership is related to male preference in inheritance, male privilege in marriage, male bias in community and state programs of land distribution as well as gender bias in the land market, with women less likely than men to be successful buyers. But there are also important differences by gender in how land is acquired. Inheritance is the primary means by which most women become landowners; men are much more likely than women to acquire land through its distribution by communities or the state and via the market. Factors contributing toward a trend toward greater gender equity in land inheritance and in recent state programs are highlighted.\r\n[Threats to Women’s Land Tenure Security and Effectiveness of Interventions - Annotated Bibliography]\r\n","author":"Jmr","notes":"From AR's Bibliography, July 2016","first_name":null,"last_name":null,"paths":["/records/2745"],"items":[{"title":"The gender asset gap: land in Latin America","description":"","created_at":"2016-07-29T12:43:50.900-07:00","updated_at":"2018-01-11T13:32:02.023-08:00","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305750X03000469","year":2003,"position":95,"published":true,"languages":["English"],"document":{"url":"/items/original/missing.png","filename":null,"content_type":null}}]},{"id":2743,"title":"Hindu Women's Property Rights in India: A Critical Appraisal","creator":"Patel, R.","published":true,"created_at":"2016-07-29T12:43:29.545-07:00","updated_at":"2017-03-24T21:20:17.347-07:00","topics":["Land \u0026 Property","Equal Rights","Co-ownership"],"countries":["India"],"category":"Research Articles","jurisdiction":"None","description":"Full citation: Patel, R. (2006). “Hindu Women's Property Rights in India: A Critical Appraisal.” Third World Quarterly, 27(7), 1255–1268. - This paper looks at changes in Hindu women’s position regarding property rights, and argues that rights conferred through law must be analyzed in light of their contexts (cultural, historical, etc.) to determine their practical legitimacy. It addresses the need to critically define the bases and contours of 'rights' as created by law. Taking the example of changes in Hindu women’s position in relation to property through the rights generated by statutory and constitutional provisions, the article critically evaluates the potential for such a 'rights regime' to enable Hindu women's greater access to property. It argues that the idea underlying a particular claim, its legitimacy and therefore effectiveness within a legal framework must be critically evaluated. The legitimacy of claims presumptively conferred within a legal framework must be interrogated in the light of legal, historical, political and cultural contexts. Such a contextual and critical analysis is crucial for effective protection of rights claims through law. To the extent that legal regimes reflect and substantiate wider social relations, their potential for bringing about substantive change in the lives of women can only be realized through ongoing critical analyses of gender, law and society.\r\n[Threats to Women’s Land Tenure Security and Effectiveness of Interventions - Annotated Bibliography]\r\n","author":"Jmr","notes":"From AR's Bibliography, July 2016","first_name":null,"last_name":null,"paths":["/records/2743"],"items":[{"title":"Hindu Women's Property Rights in India: A Critical Appraisal","description":"","created_at":"2016-07-29T12:43:34.833-07:00","updated_at":"2018-01-11T13:32:02.023-08:00","url":"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01436590600933453?journalCode=ctwq20","year":2006,"position":95,"published":true,"languages":["English"],"document":{"url":"/items/original/missing.png","filename":null,"content_type":null}}]},{"id":2738,"title":"Land Tenure Rights for Women Under Customary Law","creator":"Benbih, K. and Katz, J.","published":true,"created_at":"2016-07-26T14:43:54.911-07:00","updated_at":"2017-03-29T13:40:42.677-07:00","topics":["Customary Practices","Equal Rights","Land \u0026 Property"],"countries":["Uganda","Indonesia","Colombia","Armenia","Multiple Countries"],"category":"Research Articles","jurisdiction":"None","description":"Full citation: Benbih, K. and Katz, J.

The cases presented illustrate various difficulties to secure land tenure for women. The GHI assessment tool finds first hand evidence of the discrepancies between constitutional laws that are mostly gender neutral and the set of unspoken social norms or customary laws that discriminate against women, by way of practices restricting women’s ability to own, inherit or individually use land.

This paper recommends that countries develop innovative strategies to address women’s equal access to land and credit directly and firmly in the economic policies. While countries have been active in developing gender policies, the approach does not have a long-term impact or maximum outreach if women’s access to resources is addressed in policies that target women only. Therefore, comprehensive mainstreaming strategies for inclusion of women need to be developed. In the case of land rights, despite the fact that much has been done already, women’s access to and control over land remains extremely low. This clearly indicates that the existing systems are not working to the full capacity or that they are not working at all.

The secondary objective was to examine the perspectives of female participants on their experiences of empowerment as a result of participation in economic SHGs in low- and middle-income countries using evidence from high-quality qualitative evaluations. The study found that women’s economic SHGs have positive statistically significant effects on various dimensions of women’s empowerment, including economic, social and political empowerment, but no statistically significant effects of SHGs on psychological empowerment. The study also found no evidence of adverse effects, including no negative consequences regarding domestic violence.

The review shows that agroforestry has the potential to offer substantial benefits to women; however, their participation is low in enterprises that are considered men's domain, such as timber and high in enterprises that have little or no commercial value, such as collection of indigenous fruits and vegetables. Data on whether women are able to manage agroforestry practices as well as men are mixed, although it is clear that women do most of the work. In cases where they do not perform well, the reasons are mostly due to scarcity of resources. In marketing, women are confined to the lower end of the value chain (retailing), which limits their control over and returns from the productive process. In order to promote gender equity in agroforestry and to ensure that women benefit fully, the paper recommends various policy, technological and institutional interventions.

There were no detectable changes before the legal amendment, with a sharp increase in land bequests to daughters occurring only after HSAA became effective.

The lack of explicit corporate gender policies and strategies have meant that prevailing socio-cultural attitudes towards gender have penalized women in relation to the costs and benefits created by the venture. A key principle is that a ‘gender neutral’ approach to agricultural investments is not enough: investors must adopt explicit gender policies and take proactive steps to ensure that company behaviors help to overcome rather than reinforce pre-existing gender inequalities. This means adopting policies to offer employment on a priority basis to those local women and men who have suffered a loss of livelihood as a result of the land acquisition. All investors should also ensure that the scheme’s membership criteria do not directly or indirectly discriminate against women, and should take proactive measures to encourage women to join. \r\nTwo fundamental aspects of land tenure governance in particular need to be addressed: the cost of land rent required for leasehold tenure and the powers vested in customary authorities. Options for communal registration of customary land tenure should be explored. Affirmative action to protect women’s rights to land and natural resources should also be prioritized including ensuring that the new land policy provides for joint registration of land under joint occupation by married people.

It finds that customary land tenure institutions have evolved toward individualized systems to provide incentives to invest in tree planting. However, contrary to the common belief that individualization of land tenure weakens women's land rights, these have been strengthened through inter vivos gifts and the practice of the Intestate Succession Law. Investment in tree planting, in turn, is affected not simply by the level of land tenure security, but also by its expected changes, as tree planting strengthens land tenure security. Cocoa yields are lower on allocated family land and rented land under share tenancy due to distorted work incentives. While men and women are equally likely to plant trees, women obtain lower yields on their cocoa plots, suggesting the presence of gender-specific constraints.

Drawing upon household asset surveys which collected individual level ownership data in Ecuador, Ghana and the state of Karnataka in India, it estimates married women’s share of couple wealth and relate it to whether major household assets are owned individually or jointly during the marriage as well as to different inheritance regimes and practices. In Ecuador, married women own 44 percent, in Ghana, 19 percent, and in Karnataka, nine percent of couple wealth. Ecuador is characterized by the partial community property regime in marriage while inheritance laws provide for all children, irrespective of sex, to be treated equally, rules that are largely followed in practice. In contrast, Ghana and India are characterized by the separation of property regime which does not recognize wives’ contribution to the formation of marital property, and by inheritance practices that are strongly male biased. Reforming marital and inheritance regimes must remain a top priority in many regions of the world if gender economic equality is to be attained.

some of the challenges and solutions for women’s access to justice in diverse legal systems. It shows that women face structural and cultural barriers to accessing justice – insufficient knowledge of rights and remedies, illiteracy or poor literacy, and lack of resources or time to participate in justice processes. This is all the more so as women usually have intensive family responsibilities. Even where women can access the formal justice sector, the outcomes of the process often fall far short of those envisaged by international standards, particularly with regard to property rights, inheritance, divorce and child custody, and spousal abuse. Focusing on legal empowerment as a way to improve both access to justice and the quality of justice women receive, the study presents strategies and best practices in both formal and informal justice systems. Legal empowerment approaches share one core concept: using the law to enable disadvantaged groups to access justice and realize basic rights. They include legal education; legal aid services; support for non-discriminatory dispute resolution fora to complement or supplement informal systems; training of paralegals; and rights awareness. In considering whether such approaches can improve the quality of justice women receive, Accessing Justice brings together a number of IDLO-sponsored case studies in Afghanistan, India, Namibia, Rwanda, Mozambique, Tanzania, Morocco, Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands. These highlight a variety of lessons for development practitioners, both in terms of engagement with the informal legal sector and, more generally, for the use of legal empowerment and top-down / bottom-up strategies. In an appropriate context, carefully designed legal empowerment strategies may constitute a valuable contribution to improving women’s access to justice.\r\n[Threats to Women’s Land Tenure Security and Effectiveness of Interventions - Annotated Bibliography]\r\n","author":"Jmr","notes":"From Laura L., February 2013","first_name":null,"last_name":null,"paths":["/records/714"],"items":[{"title":"Accessing Justice: Models, Strategies and Best Practices on Women's Empowerment","description":"\r\n","created_at":"2013-03-02T22:21:03.968-08:00","updated_at":"2018-01-11T13:32:02.023-08:00","url":"http://www.idlo.int/publications/accessing-justice-models-strategies-and-best-practices-womens-empowerment","year":2013,"position":93,"published":true,"languages":["English"],"document":{"url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/landesa_production/resource/764/IDLO_Accessing-justice-models-strategies-and-best-practices-on-womens-empowerment_2013.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAICR3ICC22CMP7DPA\u0026Expires=1542754225\u0026Signature=uNFJs%2BfSfHOPItL69HayTyFJGfk%3D","filename":"IDLO_Accessing-justice-models-strategies-and-best-practices-on-womens-empowerment_2013.pdf","content_type":"application/pdf"}}]},{"id":447,"title":"From Being Property of Men to Becoming Equal Owners?

Early Impacts of Land Regulation and Certification of Women in Southern Ethiopia,\" FINAL RESEARCH REPORT (UN-HABITAT and GLTN, January 2008). - Land certification has been implemented in Ethiopia since 1998 and over 5 million certificates have been delivered. This study in the Oromiya region (OR) and the Southern Nations, Nationalities and Peoples region (SNNPR) of Ethiopia, aims to assess the early impacts of land registration and certification that has been implemented there since 2004. Special emphasis is placed on the impacts of the reform on women, including the impacts of joint certification for husbands and wives. While the land laws first introduced in the Oromiya and SNNP regions in 2002 and 2003 stated that the husband could have his name on only one certificate, resistance caused a change such that certificates could be issued jointly to the husband and his wives, or the husband’s name could also be included below the name of his second and later wives, while he has his name first on the certificate with his first wife. \r\n\r\nThe study finds that low-cost land reform in Southern Ethiopia has contributed to increase the perceptions of tenure security for both women and men. The women’s names on the land certificates increased the perception that the women would be able to keep the land after the divorce or death of their husband, with some differences among wives in polygamous households. The reform had limited impact on women’s ability to influence farm management, perhaps because of the prevalence of sharecropping. The study recommends that information dissemination, mobilisation and organisation of women’s group.

Rather, we are faced with a more complex question of how the two systems interact and are used by different groups of women and men. The research also emphasizes the need to think about customary law as “living” and evolving. \r\n• Addressing land injustices requires varied approaches that streamline and consolidate numerous land laws in a given country. It is vital to establish and maintain links among research, policy, practice, and people. \r\n• The importance of providing teaching and training in a variety of disciplines for a young generation of women in Africa cannot be overstated.\r\n\r\n[Threats to Women’s Land Tenure Security and Effectiveness of Interventions - Annotated Bibliography]","author":"Jmr","notes":"R.

D. and Leon, M., \"Who Owns the Land? Gender and Land-Titling Programmes in Latin America,\" 1(3) JOURNAL OF AGRARIAN CHANGE 440 (July 2001). - The main focus of state intervention in Latin American agriculture in the 1990s was on land-titling programs, designed to promote security of tenure and enliven land markets. A review of seven of these projects suggests that they were often designed without sufficient attention to civil codes and marital regimes that protect women's property rights. They often ignored that a household's endowment of land may consist of three forms of property: the wife's, the husband's, and jointly owned property. By assuming that the family farm is owned by the male household head, these projects trampled upon women's ownership rights. Nonetheless, the share of female beneficiaries of land-titling projects has been much higher than the share of women adjudicated land under the agrarian reforms of previous decades. This is partly because the primary way that women acquire land is through inheritance, and inheritance appears to be more gender equitable than other manners of acquiring land.

It recommends that projects make gender a focus, adequately assess political, legal, and socio-cultural factors regarding gender, and provide training to the community covering: the legal rights of women specifically, including inheritance and divorce; special problems encountered by women such as documentation, location of registration offices, access to credit; involvement of both men and women in the adjudication process and in registration of rights; and clear communication of the benefits of participation.\r\n\r\n[Threats to Women’s Land Tenure Security and Effectiveness of Interventions - Annotated Bibliography]\r\n","author":"Jmr","notes":"Items identified from EOS by Jen C., January 2013","first_name":null,"last_name":null,"paths":["/records/378"],"items":[{"title":"Gender and Property Rights: A Critical Issue in Urban Economic Development","description":"","created_at":"2013-01-10T16:40:36.832-08:00","updated_at":"2018-01-11T13:32:02.023-08:00","url":"http://www.urban.org/publications/412387.html","year":2011,"position":93,"published":true,"languages":["English"],"document":{"url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/landesa_production/resource/410/Rabenhorst_gender-and-property-rights-a-critical-issue-in-urban-economic-dev_July-2011.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAICR3ICC22CMP7DPA\u0026Expires=1542754225\u0026Signature=do7JBHrfQkwwj%2BzhytWFTcQPbTs%3D","filename":"Rabenhorst_gender-and-property-rights-a-critical-issue-in-urban-economic-dev_July-2011.pdf","content_type":"application/pdf"}}]},{"id":231,"title":"Women's Land Rights in Rural China: Transforming Existing Laws into a Source of Property Rights ","creator":"Liaw, R.

H., \"Women's Land Rights in Rural China: Transforming Existing Laws into a Source of Property Rights,\" 17(1) PACIFIC RIM LAW \u0026 POLICY JOURNAL 237 (2008). - In the aftermath of legal reforms designed to secure land tenure for farmers, women in rural China lost rights to land at marriage, divorce, and widowhood. Despite a central legal framework that facially protects women’s property interests, ambiguity in the property and marriage laws have allowed village leaders to reassert traditional social norms and deny constitutional equal rights guarantees for women. Recent attempts to ameliorate landlessness for women, specifically in the Rural Contract Law and the Property Law, offer little promise of providing a significant solution for rural women. New proposals to mitigate rural women’s loss of land rights must be framed in the cultural context of how social relations affect land rights. Legal reforms in rural China should focus on strengthening women’s property rights within marriage, as well as securing external rights to property. Women’s land tenure would be better protected under a more clearly defined community property regime that recognizes rural land contracts issued both prior to and during marriage as jointly possessed. Such measures would give women access to a legal platform at divorce or widowhood, when they are most likely to experience landlessness.

(2014). “Improving Land Tenure Security for Women: A Starting with Women Approach.” - This paper discusses a pragmatic, adaptive framework and approach for understanding and taking action to strengthen women’s land tenure security in the context of customary tenure in northern Uganda. The project team developed a Women’s Land Rights Framework (“Framework”), which provided a specific definition of secure land rights. The Framework defines secure land rights in terms of five elements, which each serves as the basis for distinct, measurable indicators upon which to base the project assessment, design, and evaluation. This paper presents the Framework and suggests its potential as an analytical foundation for assessing the security of land rights, for designing projects or developing policies that protect and strengthen women’s land rights, and for evaluating the effectiveness of such policies or projects.\r\n[Threats to Women’s Land Tenure Security and Effectiveness of Interventions - Annotated

Such social processes have led to the gendering of rural land tenure practices, but also a highly heterogeneous situation with regard to land tenure. This paper aims to demonstrate that the combined effect of marital relations, kinship, social network and low political representation of women in the community often results in the deprivation of women's land rights and many women are becoming landless.
